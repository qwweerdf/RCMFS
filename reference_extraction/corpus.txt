Racism is still a problem within our society today, and many ethnic minorities face inequalities in many areas, including education, housing, and employment.
Ethnic minorities are concentrated into certain areas of the job market, such as manufacture and communication (Brown, 1992), are most likely to be the victims of assault (Abercrombie et al, 1994), and recent surveys have shown that racist ideas still exist in society.
This can be seen in a survey, carried out in 1993, that asked a white sample whether they agreed or disagreed with the statement: 'Immigration has enriched the quality of life in Britain' and nearly half of the sample disagreed (Abercrombie et al, 1994, p255).
In this essay I will look at what racism is, and how it is defined in contemporary society, and I will then explore why it still persists.
In this section I will cover three areas that I think have contributed to the continued existence of racism; culture, economy and politics, all of which have meant that racism is an integral and internalised part of our society, however I will not be looking at individual or specific cases of racism, rather exploring a broader explanation as to why it continues.
Racism is a very hard concept to define.
Hall argues that it is not a static phenomenon, but is constantly changing and redefining (Hall, 1978, cited in Miles, 1989, p64).
In the nineteenth century racism was a product of scientific ideas, and the belief that people could be distinguished by the term race, using particular physical features, and that certain races were superior to others (Miles, 1989).
However throughout the nineteenth century racism was rejected as a scientific concept (Banton, 1987, cited in Miles, 1989, p49).
It is now important to realise that racism is not just an ideology but also a practice, and in contemporary society it has been defined as a process by which subordinated groups are excluded.
This idea is expanded on by Carmichael and Hamilton who argue that it is; 'the predication of decisions and policies on considerations of race for the purpose of subordinating a racial group and maintaining control over that group' (Carmichael and Hamilton, 1968, cited in Miles, 1989, p51).
This acknowledges that racism is not just a belief, but also an action, but in this essay I will concentrate on why the ideology of racism is still prevalent within society, as without the continuation of the ideology then racist actions would not take place.
I will now look at why racism still persists in society, and the first explanation I will consider is culture.
Racist beliefs are part of a legacy of both the slave trade and colonialism as racial categorisation played a large part in the justification of both periods.
The idea that humankind was split into different races and that certain races, usually white British, were superior was strong at the time, and reinforced to justify slavery and imperialism.
These ideas have left a strong legacy in coloniser societies today (Fenton, 1999).
Europeans constructed themselves as the representatives of superior civilisation, and in doing so also constructed those from other countries as the 'Other', a group of people who were uncivilised, and therefore inferior to the West, an idea that was reinforced through literature, as many travellers at the time focused on the abnormal characteristics of the 'Other', and helped construct the idea that they were barbaric and uncivilised (Miles, 1989).
Characteristics such as cannibalism and the degradation of women were picked out as features that made those from the colonised states racially inferior, and uncivilised, and reinforced the idea that a racialist hierarchy existed that placed those from the West at the top.
By defining people from these countries as the 'Other' they were automatically excluded from the society of the West (Miles, 1989).
Although this construction is no longer as prevalent in society, it has impacted on racism in society today.
Images and ideas that were associated with the 'Other', for example the veil in Islam, are still around today, and the racial ideas that were leant to these images still exist.
There is also the idea that White Europeans wished to continue their superiority over colonised societies, so sustained the ideas associated with the inferior 'Other' in order to maintain it (Fenton, 1999).
It can also be argued that racism persists through culture due to the ideas of nationalism.
Nationalism is a very popular discourse in contemporary society, as it was during the period of colonialisation, and the two are very closely linked, with ideas of nationalism often associated with both the ideology and actions of racism (Fenton, 1999).
Overall colonialism has impacted on the racist ideas prevalent in today's society, as although the concept of 'Other' that existed in the nineteenth century no longer continues the definition of 'Other' has changed (Miles, 1989), and it has left a legacy of racism in contemporary society.
However this is not the only reason for the continuation of racism, economic factors have also had an impact.
The racism apparent at the time of colonialisation has been reinforced through the labour market.
During this period the racial ideas were put into practice in the economy as those constructed as the 'Other' were exploited through the trade links established with the colonies, by those in power (Miles, 1989) showing that racialism has been imbedded into the economy since before capitalism.
However since the emergence of capitalism these racist ideas have been used to support the capitalist market.
Capitalists have ensured that ethnic minorities are viewed as suitable only for menial jobs, as they can easily exploit them, and this has reinforced the idea that race determines your skills and abilities, therefore causing racism to be imbedded within the capitalist market (Fenton, 1999).
Castles and Kosack have argued that capitalism requires a 'reserve army of labour' to ensure the successful continuation of the economic production along capitalist values, and that ethnic minorities provide this army (Procter, Lecture notes, 2004).
However by constructing ethnic minorities as a reserve army of labour racist beliefs are reinforced, as they are viewed as both inferior and only suitable for inferior jobs, but also as a threat to the white workers, creating a sense of racism in white workers.
Therefore the racist beliefs apparent in the culture of colonialism are recreated in the current economy, ensuring that racism persists, although there are some problems with this idea as it ignores the white people employed in menial jobs and over emphasises the idea that ethnic minorities are needed as a 'reserve army of labour' (Miles, 1989).
However politics, and the policies of British political parties over the twentieth century have also ensured that these racial ideas continue.
Since the Second World War British politics reinforced have the idea that those from other races are inferior.
In the 1950s both the Labour and Conservative Parties were openly racist (Brown, 1992), and they constructed immigrants as a social problem.
Throughout the 1950s the debates on immigration focused on the idea that the number of black immigrants entering Britain needed to be restricted as they were posing a threat to British society.
Immigrants were linked with social problems, including shortages of housing and crime, and through this connection racism was reinforced, as people began to see immigrants and people from other races as a problem.
Emphasis was put on their undesirable behaviour, for example crime, and prostitution, despite the fact that much of this was not carried out by immigrants (Solomos, 1989, ensuring that people linked the idea of undesirable with immigrants.
This construction of immigrants as a problem continued throughout out the 1960s, and in 1962 the Commonwealth Immigrants Act was introduced, which placed restrictions on the number of black immigrants entering the country (Solomos, 1989).
By the 1970s legislation had been bought in which controlled the entry of non-white immigrants through a voucher system, giving the government control over who entered the country, and what work they could do following their entry (Brown, 1992).
This political racism persisted after 1979, with Margaret Thatcher again emphasising the danger to British society that immigrants pose (Solomos, 1989), and these ideas can still be seen today, with the current clamp-down on the number of asylum seekers entering the country.
Overall the policies of the government since the Second World War have made racism an integral part of our society, and ensured that non-whites are still viewed with distaste and seen as inferior.
In conclusion racism, which can be defined as an ideology which categorises people as inferior according to their race, and is put into practice through many policies and actions, which seek to exclude non-whites from many areas of society, can still be seen in today's society.
There are three reasons for this.
Firstly the culture of colonialism and the belief that the 'Other' is inferior is still apparent in our society today.
Secondly these beliefs are reinforced through the economy, as capitalism exploits ethnic minorities, and ensures that they are viewed as less skilled, and finally racism is embedded in our political system through the policies of political parties and the links they make between non-white immigrants and social problems.
All of these processes work together in contemporary society to ensure that racism still continues, and non-whites are excluded.
Official statistics are those produced by either the state, or by one of its agencies.
There has been a huge increase in the number of official statistics since the Central Statistics Office was set up in 1941, and now large quantities of statistics are produced on a variety of different topics, for example income, housing and population.
Although they are widely used there are many limitations of the use official statistics in sociology.
In this essay I plan to talk about how the internal, or posivitist schools view statistics, looking at how they are critical of the reliability and validity of official statistics, and also how they feel that the processes involved in producing the statistics limit their uses.
I will also explore the uses that statistics do have in sociology, and come to a conclusion on whether they should be use or not.
The internal school of thought emphasises the need for reliability and validity in order to produce realistic statistics, however there are many problems with official statistics in this aspect, and as Hindess points out "they cannot be taken as a...reliable account" (Hindess, 1973).
The term reliability refers to whether the statistics are replicable or not, and validity is defined as whether they paint a true picture of what they are looking at, and there are many problems with regards to both.
The first problem is that of the definition of concept, and can cause problems with the reliability of the statistics.
Different people define concepts in different ways so this alters the reliability of the study, and also means that readers may interpret the statistics in a different way to that which they were intended (Hindess, 1973, Shipman, 1973, May, 1997).
Hindess points out that if concepts are defined differently it can have a huge result on the statistics (Hindess, 1973, cited in Irvine et al, 1979), and in Demystifying Statistics Irvine uses the example of unemployment, claiming that over the past three decades the definition of unemployment has altered many times, and this has big impact on the number of people who are defined as unemployed, according o the statistics (Irvine and Miles, 1979).
The next problem is linked to validity.
Official statistics go through a long process of decision making before the final result is reached (Hindess, 1973, May, 1997), even down to what methodology is used, and this process can alter the results greatly.
In Social Research May uses the example of crime statistics to show this.
The first decision in the process here is that of what is a crime in terms of the law.
This would have a huge impact on crime statistics, for example if marital rape was not illegal then the crime statistics of rape would be very different.
The second decision is made by the victim of the crime; whether to report it or not, which means that the formation of official statistics is not just influenced by those composing them, but also by decisions made by those involved in the actual area (May, 1997).
Human judgement is a key factor in this criticism, but as the decision process shows it is not just the judgement of those composing the statistics that is involved (Hindess, 1973).
This means that as the process continues the statistics become further distorted as different people's views and decisions become involved.
This idea can be illustrated using the example of suicide.
The official statistics produced on this topic are not only influenced by those collating the statistics, but also by those determining the causes of death.
This can be seen by the fact that in the past Catholic priests did not like to categorise the cause of a death as 'suicide', so the term 'natural cause' would have been used instead, resulting in a very different set of statistics in the end.
Cicourel also supports this idea; however he takes it one step further by saying that these decisions are influenced by people's background experiences (Cicourel, cited in Hindess, 1973).
This means that even if two people from the same organisation tried to collect the same results there would be complications as they have had different experiences.
Overall this shows that reliability and validity are hard to establish in official statistics, due to the number of human decisions involved, and the different ways in which people apply concepts.
However according to the radical approach there are more limitations with statistics.
The radical approach tells us that us that official statistics tell us more about the state than they do the topics they are exploring, therefore statistics should be viewed as a construction, and as Irvine and Miles say; "statistics are not collected, but produced" (Irvine and Miles, 1979).
Official statistics are not neutral perceptions of a topic, but instead reflect political agendas (Irvine and Miles, 1979) and the aims of those with political power (May, 1997).
One example of this is the way in which the government produced official statistics relating to unemployment under Margaret Thatcher.
During her time in power the definition of unemployment changed over twenty times, as the aim of the statistics was to show how unemployment was decreasing, and the most successful way in which to achieve this was to alter the definition of the concept of unemployment.
This shows how the aims and motives of those collecting the data can influence the final statistics.
Radical thinkers also believe that statistics only tell us about the groups in society who hold power, and are simply a reflection of the balances of power in society (Hesteretal, 1996, cited in May, 1997).
Official statistics do not exist on all topics that sociologists may want to look at, and as a result can be very limiting for them, but also only present a one sided view of society.
One example of this is servants in the Victorian era.
Many statistics from this time were produced by those in positions of power, for example mistresses, so they tell us little about the lives of the servants, who were working class and held little power.
However, despite these limitations official statistics do have some uses.
According to posivitists as long as the statistics are reliable and valid then hey are very useful, and one example of this is birth and death rates.
As the registration of births and deaths are legal requirements the statistics are reliable, and paint a valid picture of the contemporary and past population levels.
Statistics that are not produced using legal requirements can also be useful, however.
Bulmer claims that statisticians often go to many lengths to avoid problems with reliability and validity, and he claims that as a result official statistics pose no more of a problem than sociological research.
He also argues that if sufficient thought is given to the production of official statistics, and more scientific, rather than theoretical concepts are used, then these problems can be corrected, however it is hard to apply this to sociological research (Bulmer, 1984, cited in May, 1997).
Using the radical approach statistics can be useful to tell us about the state and those in power, and what they are interested in.
However radicals argue that if the processes involved in the construction of official statistics are carefully considered when analysing the results then the statistics can be seen to present a useful and valid picture of society (Hindess, 1973).
However radicals also argue that official statistics are used most successfully, and paint the most realistic picture when they are combined with another method (May, 1997), for example self report studies when the topic of crime is being studied, as this allows the decision making process involved in the official statistics to be balanced out, as people are more likely to be honest in a self report study.
Overall, according to the posivitists the main limitations of official statistics arise from the issues of reliability and validity, however they feel that in many cases these limitations are overcome by careful planning, so argue that sociologists should use official statistics.
Radicals on the other hand, believe that official statistics are a construction of the state, and this means that although they are useful for examining the state and its interests they do not provide a realistic picture of society.
I feel sociologists should use official statistics especially when examining those with power, or exploring the state, however they should treat official statistics produced on other topics with care, and be aware of the process of decision making and methodology that occurs before the statistics are finally produced.
Since the fourteenth century the practice of medicine has become a profession, and more importantly, a male-dominated profession.
Previously medicine was seen as a female duty, however all areas of medicine have been professionalized over the centuries, and slowly become male-dominated, even the practice of obstetrics, which until the twentieth century, was still viewed as a female responsibility.
This rise of medicine has had many implications for women; in this essay I will discuss them.
The most important, both in terms of gender and class, was the exclusion of women from what had previously been a female occupation, and their confinement into inferior areas of medicine.
However I will also examine the effects the rise of the profession of medicine had on women in relation to how women were viewed from the nineteenth century onward, and also the practical impacts that it had upon women receiving treatment, especially in the case of childbirth.
In terms of class I will look at how working-class women received different treatments, as a result of the rise of medicine as a profession, and also how, consequently, the divisions between working-class and upper-class women increased.
I will begin by looking at one of the most important implications; women's exclusion from medicine.
In previous centuries health care tended to be carried out by female lay-healers within the community (Witz, 1992).
Female lay-healers were valued members of the community and as a result gained high status.
They cared for the sick and elderly, and were also relied upon to produce drugs and remedies for their patients (Moscucci, 1990).
As females were seen as closer to the earth it was felt that they were most suited to carrying out the role of carer within the community, however medicine slowly began to develop as a form of science, rather than an occupation relating to nature, and male domination of the occupation began.
From the 1700's the view developed that rationality and science were most important, however these were qualities associated with men, rather than women, who were seen as emotional and religious, not scientific, and as the body began to be viewed from a scientific perspective it was these qualities that were required in the practice of medicine (Donnison, 1993).
Men also placed emphasis upon these qualities to justify their dominant role within medicine.
Education was introduced to train people in the practice of medicine, and in 1858, the Medical Registration Act secured medicine as a profession (Witz, 1992).
However, this also ensured the exclusion of women from medicine.
As medicine came to be based on qualifications, rather than experience, patriarchal institutions were able to ensure women were excluded from medicine.
They were unable to gain entry into the Universities offering qualifications in medicine, for example the University of Edinburgh, and prevented from taking exams that would gain them a place on the Medical Register (Witz, 1992).
Although several women, including Sophie Jex Blake, managed to gain university places, they were subject to prejudice and abuse by fellow students, and following their entry onto the Medical Register, universities changed their policies, ensuring that although women could study medicine, they would not necessarily qualify to practice it (Witz, 1992).
This exclusion of women can also be traced in the area of midwifery.
Until the twentieth century midwifery was viewed as a female responsibility, being viewed as inferior to other areas.
Although from the 1700s onwards there were several man-midwives, they did not deal with routine births, stepping in only if there was a problem; their role was similar to that of a surgeon (Donnison, 1993).
However post-1730's their role changed, and they became increasingly involved in routine births, especially with the upper and middle classes.
What was seen as 'a problem birth' was redefined, for example prior to this time breech births were regarded as normal, and female midwives considered able to deal with them competently, but as they came to be seen as a problem, male surgeons began to participate in an increasing number (Oakley, 1984).
Despite these advances, it was not until the twentieth century that midwifery became recognised as central to general practice (Moscucci, 1990), and qualifications were deemed necessary to practice of midwifery, with the 1902 Midwives Act (Oakley, 1984).
This resulted in women being further pushed out of an area which they had continued to dominate, despite the professionalisation of the rest of medicine.
This also had class implications, as although women were accepted by lying-in hospitals to train in midwifery they had to pay for the privilege, ensuring that it was only those from the skilled classes who could qualify (Donnison, 1993).
Previously, midwifery had been based largely on experience rather than qualification, so was practiced by many working-class women.
Overall, one of the most important implications for women, was their excluded from an occupation previously regarded as female, as well as ensuring that only certain classes could enter the profession, which limited the options open to women who needed to work.
It impact can still be seen today, as medicine is still a male-dominated practice, and the areas that women do enter, for example nursing, are regarded as inferior to the male-dominated areas, such as surgery.
However it was not the only significant impact.
Another major implication was the way in which women were depicted by the medical profession.
As men wished to justify their exclusion of women from medicine, they redefined how women were viewed.
As well continuing to portray them as too emotional to enter what they saw as the world of science, men also began to associate women's bodies with evil, claiming they were inherently dangerous, and therefore needed controlling (Smart, 1992).
This would ensure that women were unable to enter medical profession, but also that men could retain control over women's bodies.
However at the same time they also depicted women as frail, and therefore dependant upon the male medical practice (Moscucci, 1990, Smart, 1992).
Both of these depictions ensured that women were unable to enter medicine, and guaranteed that it remained a male dominated profession.
This had class implications for women, as those from the working classes were seen as the most dangerous, whereas frailty was largely associated with the upper and middle classes, which strengthened the divide between the upper and lower classes.
It also impacted upon legislation, with further implications for women.
As women were construed as dirty and dangerous by the medical profession, laws were created reflecting this point, for example the Contagious Diseases Acts in the 1860's (Smart, 1992), which created further controls for women, especially those from the working classes.
The professionalisation of medicine also affected women in a more personal way.
As it ensured the exclusion of women from medicine it meant that women seeking medical help had to see a male doctor (Donnison, 1993), a change that caused problems especially in childbirth.
It resulted in loss of dignity for women, as many did not wish to see a male doctor in such situations, resulting in many deaths as female midwives were not trained to deal with the problems, or meant that male surgeons had 'to work blind', under the covers, creating many errors (Donnison, 1993).
This implication was significant, as it was so personal, and did not just affect women who wished to enter the medical profession but all female patients.
Having discussed the implications for women in relation to gender, and in some ways class, I will now focus more closely upon the class impacts.
As the practice of medicine moved away from female lay-healing and towards a male profession many working-class women were denied access to medical care.
As it became a profession the working classes could no longer afford to receive treatment, so many went without (Donnison, 1993), and the medical profession focused its attention on upper- class women, claiming they were more fragile and in need of extra help, which further excluded working-class women from medical treatment.
The few hospitals set up to provide for the working classes were poor quality, and the women were subjected to harsh treatments, which the upper classes who could afford to pay for superior treatment were not.
They were treated as if they were dirty in some way, in a similar way to which prostitutes were handled under the Contagious Diseases Acts (Moscucci, 1990).
Upper-class women were able to use chloroform during birth, but no such aids were available to those from the working classes (Donnison, 1993).
Such differences in treatment helped to increase the division between the working and upper classes that I mentioned previously.
Overall the rise of medicine as a profession had many implications for women.
It excluded them from the practice, an occupation which had previously been female, a result which had many further implications for women in both gender and class terms.
It resulted in the redefining of women, into inherently dangerous, yet fragile human beings, who were therefore dependant upon men, and the male medical profession, as well as having a negative affect on women patients, as many did not wish to see male doctors.
It also removed one of the final areas of society from which women could gain status, ensuring that men now acquired this standing, as well as excluding working-class women from treatment as they could no longer afford it, increasing the divisions between women of different classes.
Therefore the rise of medicine as a profession turned it into an area of male-dominance, reduced women's power and ensured that male control over women increased, as did the control of the upper classes over the working classes.
The rise had a largely negative effect upon women, especially those from the working classes, and its legacy can still be seen in medicine today.
Much more reproductive choice is now available to women, with the ability to chose whether or not to have children, when to have them and in what context, now a reproductive right given to women.
This, combined with shifting social and economic opportunities for women, has lead to an increase in the number of childless women, with, in 1991, twice as many saying that they expected to remain childless as in 1986 (Gillespie, 2001).
However the anticipated number of children per woman in Europe and the USA is still near or above two (Bongaarts, 1999), showing that many are still having children.
In this essay I will explore why women have children, even though there is now more opportunity for them not to, and why those who do not have children do not do so.
I will begin by looking at why women do have children, exploring the idea of push and pull in the decision, introduced by Morrell (1994), looking at factors identified as 'pulling' women into motherhood; psychological, social and economic factors, as well as looking at the influences of 'push' factors such as national discourses on motherhood and social policy.
I will then examine why women do not have children or remain, as Gillespie describes, as voluntarily childless, (2001), considering the influence of personal, social and economic factors, and changing opportunities for women.
In considering all of these influences on why women do or do not have children I will look at how they all work together to form a complex process, not just a simple decision.
Morrell argues that women do not choose to have children only because it is something that they would like to experience and are attracted to, but also because they are almost forced into it by national discourses on motherhood and social policies, illustrated when she says; 'women are not only pulled to mothering, women are pushed in this direction in part by cultural representations of both motherhood and childlessness' (1994, p145).
This means that a complex combination of personal choices and cultural influences combine in women's decisions to have children.
Many personal reasons for women having children have been identified.
The society in which we now live is disaggregated and lonely, and it is argued that women may want children to compensate for this (Andorka, 1978), as they are seen by many as a constant source of love and affection, and are usually totally dependant upon their parents.
This idea is supported by Coldwell, who says; 'one's own children provide a unique pleasure which is not substitutable' (1982, cited in Schoen et al, 1997, p335), showing that many women chose to have children for the unique personal rewards that they carry.
It is also argued that children are a source of self expansion, enabling women to feel they are moral and altruistic people for producing them (Hoffman and Hoffman, 1973, cited in Andorka, 1978, p338), and that they are a way of reproducing ones self and ensuring ones characteristics remain, an influence becoming perhaps more important as life after death is no longer considered a reality (Gittins, 1993).
However as well as personal factors attracting women to motherhood, economic and social factors may also be influential.
Lancaster has argued that children do provide some economic profit, as they can be a way of claiming higher benefits and gaining access to housing, (1965, cited in Andorka, 1978, p364).
However it is now felt that economic factors do not influence the decision as much as in previous times, as women are no longer economically dependant upon men, and children are not needed to provide a source of income.
Instead social factors have more of an input.
Coleman claims that children are a form of 'social capital' (1988, cited in Schoen et al, 1997, p337), as they provide women with social benefits that they might not otherwise have, and this gain can influence the decision to have children.
Having children can mean the development of social relationships that can be beneficial to women, and ensure higher standings within a social network (Schoen et al, 1997).
Becoming a parent signals adult status has been reached, and this can result in acceptance into certain prestigious social groups, or the chance for social mobility (Hoffman and Hoffman, 1973, cited in Andorka, 1978, p338), for example some workplaces reward workers who have children as they are seen as mature and responsible.
Although this is more applicable to male workers, it can mean that if a man is given promotion the whole family will be seen differently by society.
It is also suggested that having children can produce better social relationships with kin networks, meaning more physical, emotional and financial support that may not otherwise have been achieved (Schoen et al, 1997).
Having children can also provide women specifically with a higher status in society, as mothers are glorified (McDaniel, 1996), and many women may wish to be regarded highly by society.
It is also argued that children can give women more power in the domestic sphere, as nurturing is seen as naturally linked to women, so they are given control over this area (Gittins, 1993), and therefore see it as a way of gaining more power within domestic relationships.
Security is another form of social capital that can be created by having children.
As well as being a source of security in the form of constant love, they can also provide social and financial security, especially in old age.
Morrell found that many women feared old age, as women are now living longer than men (1994) and this fear can mean that women choose to have children to ensure their security, therefore making them an important social resource.
These more individual and personal reasons that influence the choice of women to have children often combine in a complex way, however they are not the only factors that affect the decision.
National discourses on motherhood and social policy have subtle influences that provide a background on which the more explicit influences of personal fulfilment and economic and social benefits are established.
Patriarchal ideology prescribes particular behaviour for marriage and reproduction; the idea that marriage is based upon heterosexual relationships and that having children is the next natural step (Gittins, 1993), meaning that many women see getting married and having children as a natural progression through life, even in modern society.
This is reinforced by strong historical discourses that link femininity with motherhood, claiming that 'true womanhood' is not reached unless women have children, or see having children as their biological and ideological goals (McDaniel, 1996).
Culture dictates that it is natural for women to be mothers, and prescribes the number of children that is seen as respectable within our society (Schneider and Schneider, 1995, cited in Schoen et al, 1997, p335).
Religious, political and scientific leaders stress that it is only through motherhood that women can be fulfilled, and Gillespie supports this, highlighting the way in which motherhood is seen as natural in modern society; 'the idea that motherhood is essentialist, deterministic, fixed, inevitably fulfilling and central to feminine identity is firmly entrenched in industrial, urban and rural societies' (2001, p141).
This discourse, as well as placing motherhood as natural and essential for defining women, also ensures that women in society without children, both voluntarily and involuntarily, are seen as failed and not proper women.
Culture also dictates that those who do not have children are selfish and immoral (Gillespie, 2001), and motherhood is seen as a signifier of normality (Morrell, 1994).
Women feel that they should fit in with what is 'normal and natural', meaning that they chose to have children.
These ideas are evident in social policy.
As the nation relies on reproduction for its continuation, the state has much interest in levels of fertility and tries to encourage women to reproduce.
This is done by reinforcing the discourses of motherhood as natural, and through more explicit social policy.
This is evident in the USA where abortion and contraception are closely controlled by the state to ensure that women consider having children as important (McDaniel, 1996).
These discourses in society influence the more personal factors that are involved on the decision to become a mother, as they promote the idea that children are a natural progression for women and their main source of happiness.
Therefore many women feel that they should have children as it will make them happy, and see it as natural in order for them to fulfil their role in society, and gain status, as society attributes status to women through motherhood in these discourses.
Consequently these cultural ideas running through society influence and combine with personal, economic and social factors to create a complex combination of reasons as to why women have children.
However, despite these dominant discourses in society not all women have children.
Although this may be down to infertility in some cases, I will be looking at the issue of voluntary childlessness, where women choose not to have children, rather than being unable to.
As with the decision to have children, there are many personal, economic and social reasons why some women choose childlessness.
Some women simply do not like children (Gillespie, 2000), or fear the effects that having a child will have upon their figure.
Others may feel that due to crime and poverty the world now is not a suitable place to bring up children, or that the conditions of the town in which they live, for example lack of space, are not equitable to having children (Andorka, 1978).
Children are also a significant emotional responsibility and some women may feel they do not wish to take this on, or may already have carried such a responsibility, either for siblings or parents and not want to endure it again (Gillespie, 2000).
There is also the influence of economic factors to consider.
Children are no longer economic assets, but are in fact very financially costly, and many women may decide they cannot afford to have children (Schoen et al, 1997).
Fears about economic security have lead to more women deciding that children are not a viable option, and that the financial burden is too high a price to pay.
Aspirations for certain standards of living may also influence the decision as some will feel that the cost of children would not fit in with the lifestyle they wish to have (Andorka, 1978).
This links quite closely to social factors, as a desired lifestyle can be quite important when considering whether or not to have children.
Opportunities other than motherhood are now open to women, especially in economic structures, and some women choose to explore these opportunities, rather than experience motherhood.
Women's increasing participation in employment means that they are able to develop careers of their own, and many feel that they gain their identity from paid work and do not want to lose this by having children (Gillespie, 2001).
Women now wish to have interests separate from the domestic sphere, and some may believe that having children places restrictions on the possibilities for this sort of lifestyle.
Morrell describes it as a desire for 'freedom from and freedom to', where women wish to have freedom from the ties, both financially and emotionally, of being mothers, but also want the freedom to experience a different lifestyle, with flexibility and no guilt.
She also found that many did not like the context under which motherhood was supposed to take place, feeling that it would enforce a break from paid employment, therefore economic dependence, and confinement to the home ensuring a sexual division of labour (1994).
These desires for a lifestyle that does not involve children have been made possible by small changes in employment structures, which mean that women can now have a career, and the emergence of discourses, albeit not mainstream ones which allow women greater sexual freedom.
Gillespie describes this as 'the post-modern model of reproduction', in which social forces have impacted upon motherhood, meaning that that it is becoming disaggregated with the natural (2001), so motherhood is no longer seen as synonymous with femininity.
This shows that as well as there being personal, economic and social factors influencing the decision not to have children, changes in employment structures and new discourses emerging on motherhood and reproduction mean that these factors are possible in modern society.
Therefore it is a complex combination of social ideals and personal responses that results in women becoming voluntarily childless.
Overall this shows that there are many complex influences upon the decision of whether or not have children.
In the decision to have children discourses on motherhood and reproduction create the ideal that motherhood is both natural and fulfilling for women, and this impacts upon personal, economic and social factors, including security, happiness and social capital, that lead to women choosing to have children.
The same idea can be seen in the decision not to have children, as changing opportunities for women, and emerging discourses are making it possible for women to decide that for personal, economic and social reasons, for example lifestyle choices, they wish to remain childless.
In conclusion why women do or do not have children is a complex process influenced by many factors, and based upon a variety of discourses and opportunities ingrained within society, not simply whether or not a woman likes children.
In the twenty five years following the Second World War the government was fully committed to full employment, however in the 1970s unemployment began to rise drastically (Vickerstaff, 2003).
The number of unemployed rose from 1.3 million in 1979 to 3 million in 1982 (Jones and Novak, 1999, p39, Glynn, 1999, p190), and as Burnett notes these figures remained high throughout the 1980s and 1990s (1994).
However although unemployment has always existed in periods of history before, this increase was significant, as new patterns emerged, with rising youth and ethnic minority unemployment, and unemployment concentrated in certain areas of the country (Ashton and Maguire, 1991).
In this essay I will briefly outline why mass unemployment emerged at this time, including factors of global changes, technological advances and government policies.
I will then move on to examine which groups were most at risk from these changes, looking closely at the young, those in industrial towns, men, especially the unskilled, and finally ethnic minorities, and exploring the reasons why they were so vulnerable.
I will not look at several other groups who were also vulnerable; those with disabilities, few qualifications and the elderly, as they had been at risk from unemployment before, and it was not the situation in the 1970s that caused this risk, as it was with the groups I will look at.
There were many reasons as to why unemployment grew in the 1980s and 1990s.
The neo-liberal and social democratic approaches have opposing views, with the neo-liberals arguing that unemployment was down to individual attitudes, and that deregulating markets would solve this problem, whilst social democratic approaches argued that it was a structural problem, that regulated markets and welfare would lessen (Vickerstaff, 2003).
However there were many more complicated factors involved in the steep decline during this period.
One of the main reasons was global changes.
Firstly the 1973 oil crisis lead to a decline in the global economy, and the British economy, causing unemployment to rise (Burnett, 1994), especially as this resulted in a shift of trade against Britain, as she was not an oil producer (Glynn, 1999).
Secondly, throughout the recession global markets began to spread, meaning that British exports began to decrease, and more low cost products were imported from abroad, so many companies went bust (Ashton and Maguire, 1991).
Also those companies who did not began to change their labour market strategy, either moving production to other countries, where labour was cheaper, or making redundancies and moving towards a more flexible workforce (Glynn, 1999).
All of these changes in the global market had a dramatic effect on the labour market within Britain, but also to industry as a whole, as it caused a massive decline in the manufacturing industry (Ashton and Maguire, 1991), which fell in production by 15.75% between 1979 and 1983 (Glynn, 1999, p270).
As manufacturing was a major employer in Britain at the time, inevitably unemployment rose, as although the service sector grew as manufacturing declined, it was not to the same extent, and fewer jobs were created.
These global changes were also further compounded by increases in technology, and government policies.
Technology displaced or made more flexible many jobs in the parts of the manufacturing industry that survived (Burnett, 1994) and meant that fewer workers were needed in the growing service sector.
It also meant that many unskilled and semi skilled jobs disappeared from the market, as technology could now be used (Mizen, 2003).
Ashton and Maguire argue that government policy made this problem worse however, as it weakened trade union power and made these changes easier for employers to introduce (1991), and Professor Laynard agrees, claiming that rising inflation, fiscal monetary policies and a lack of commitment to full employment caused dramatic increases in unemployment (Laynard, cited in Burnett, 1994, p268).
One of the groups most affected by these changes was the young, and Makeham claims that they are now especially vulnerable to general trends in employment (1980, cited in Coles, 1995, p 32).
In 1960 the unemployment rate for the under 25s was only 2.4%, however by 1979 it had increased to 12.2% and by 1981 it had risen further to 21.4% (Coles, 1995, p32).
This trend is one that still continues today, and in 1996, half a million 19-24 year olds were classified as unemployed (Jones and Novak, 1999, p64).
These statistics can further be placed in context by looking at the fact that although general unemployment was rising at the time, which could simply be reflected in these figures, it only rose by 45%, whereas youth unemployment rose by 120% (Coles, 1995, p32).
There are many reasons as to why the young are so vulnerable to these changes.
It is argued that they are especially vulnerable to the business cycle anyway, as in times of recession businesses cut their recruitment and training and inflate the experience and qualifications needed for financial reasons, as do Trade Unions, who aim to protect their existing members, meaning that the young have very little opportunity to enter into the work force.
Also due to statutory redundancy payments it is cheaper to sack those who have been in work for the shortest period, and this usually applied to the young (Mizen, 2003).
However, although this does make the young more vulnerable, the reasons why they became one of the highest groups in unemployment in the 1980s and 1990s has to be placed in context.
Firstly the global changes and resulting decline in the manufacturing industry impacted significantly upon them, as it was previously a large source of youth employment, with one third of school leavers entering the industry (Mizen, 2003).
This loss should have been compensated by the growth in the service sector, however many employers preferred adult female workers, and began to reject the young, reflecting the fact that Maguire claims, employers often view the young as irresponsible and lacking training and experience (1992), therefore making them more at risk in times of high unemployment.
Technological advances also impacted as many of the jobs they displaced were in the manufacturing sector, which was a major source of youth employment, but also because it meant that fewer apprenticeships were offered (Coles, 1995), so the young could not get the training or the experience needed to enter the labour market initially.
Burnett supports the idea that it meant that the young lacked the higher criteria requested by employers due to economic decline, but also points out that at the time adult wages were changed to apply to 18 year olds as well, not just older workers (1994), so it was now no cheaper for employers to hire young people.
As well as being especially vulnerable to these changes in the labour market structure, the risk posed to the young was further increased by government policies.
They blamed youth unemployment on what is known as the 'deficiency model' (Mizen, 2003), which argued that the reason the young were out of work was because they were restless in work, had no incentive to be there, or did not have the qualities needed for employment.
This meant they received little support from the government to protect them from the dangers of unemployment.
Therefore overall the recent changes in the labour market, technological advances and government policies have made the young a group particularly at risk of unemployment.
Another group at risk to high unemployment were those living in traditional industrial towns, especially in the North and West.
Statistics show that whilst the rate of official unemployment was only 8.4% in the South East, in the North West it was 14.7%, and in the North 16.6%, indicating that industrial areas were at a higher risk of unemployment (Jones and Novak, 1999, p41).
Within these areas places such as Yorkshire, Scotland and Humberside were the worst affected, and Ashton et al found that a young man's chance of being unemployed in Sunderland was one in three, compared to only one in thirty three in St Albans (1988, cited in Coles, 1995, p39).
Pissarides and Wadsworth note that this is largely due to the occupational distribution of employment (1992).
These areas were where manufacturing production was concentrated, and when this went into decline due to global changes, these areas lost their main source of jobs.
They also did not experience the benefits bought about by the increase in the service sector, as the growth of business was concentrated mostly in the South East, growing by 20% per year in these areas, compared to only 7.2% in the North West (McLaughlin, 1992, p14).
Burnett supports this argument, saying that the structural changes that have occurred in the labour market, most notably the change from manufacturing production to service sector domination, have led to high job losses in certain areas, especially in industrial towns (1994).
Technological advances have further increased the risk of unemployment in these areas as they have meant that many of the remaining jobs have become flexible (Vickerstaff, 2003).
The people living within these areas were made even more vulnerable to these risks, as they become largely cut off from other cities where the service sector is now dominating, meaning they were excluded from job information networks and fell into a downward spiral ending in a culture of unemployment (Ashton and Maguire, 1991).
These reasons have all combined to ensure that over the past thirty years people living in these industrial areas have been more affected by unemployment.
Men, especially the unskilled, are another group at risk from unemployment, and who suffered during the mass unemployment of the 1980s and 1990s.
Unemployment for men over 25 has increased four fold since the 1970s (Faggio and Nickell, 2003, p 31), with 2.3 million fewer men in work now than twenty years ago (Jones and Novak, 1999, p40).
There are several reasons for this decline in male employment.
Firstly, they were the main workers in the manufacturing industry, so when this declined their levels of unemployment increased (Ashton and Maguire, 1991).
Although the service sector grew to replace manufacturing as a source of employment, women were favoured by employers due to their characteristics, and the way they were perceived as more caring and understanding, and also reliable, especially if they were married (Maguire, 1992).
This idea is demonstrated clearly by Ashton and Maguire when they say; 'the new service sector jobs have provided low skilled, part-time and often casual employment, primarily for females' (1991, p53).
The position of men, especially the unskilled, in the labour market has been further undermined by the global changes and technological advances that were taking place in the 1970s (Faggio and Nickell, 2003).
The movement of production to developing countries meant that many unskilled and manual jobs were displaced, and it was previously men filled these positions.
These developments therefore make men more vulnerable to unemployment, as the jobs they formerly had no longer exist, and the new jobs emerging in the service sector were seen as better suited to the innate skills of women.
The final group vulnerable to unemployment are ethnic minorities, however it should be noted that this category needs to be disaggregated, as unemployment is especially significant for Afro-Caribbean's and Bangladeshi workers, but does not affect Asian workers, especially those from India or China, to the same extent.
Pissarides and Wadsworth have identified this group as vulnerable, however, saying; 'race has a large effect on unemployment' (1992, p66).
Statistics show that by 1986 the rate of white unemployment was 9.1% compared to 15.1% for non-whites (Pissarides and Wadsworth, 1992, p66).
More recently Coles found that those identifying themselves as black were twice as likely to be unemployed (1995, p40).
There are several reasons for this.
Firstly many of them have lower educational achievements, with 40% of Bangladeshis having no formal qualifications (Wadsworth, 2003, p119), and in times of recession, as was occurring in the 1980s employers raise the qualifications necessary to move into employment, so ethnic minorities would have been put at risk.
This could also be linked to the fact that many have a lack of language skills and familiarity with British institutions (Wadsworth, 2003), which employers may no longer have found acceptable in a time when a large reserve army of labour existed.
Secondly racial discrimination existed, and still exists in the labour market, with employers perceiving ethnic minorities as lacking an innate ability (McLaughlin, 1992).
If employers base the criteria for workers upon this it puts some ethnic minorities at a very high risk of unemployment.
Finally Jenkins argues that as with those in industrial towns, ethnic minorities have limited access to job information networks, so they do not get the same opportunities as those with access (1986, cited in Maguire, 1992).
This shows that some ethnic minorities are at a very high risk as they have lower qualification and skill levels, but also face exclusion and discrimination within the labour market, especially one with more focus upon the service sector than manufacturing.
In conclusion there were four main groups who were at risk from unemployment, and therefore most vulnerable to mass unemployment in the 1980s and 1990s.
The young were at risk due to global changes in the labour market; which caused a decline in manufacturing in Britain, technological advances, and government policies, and those in industrial areas suffered largely for similar reasons, as the decline in manufacturing hit these areas hard.
Again it was largely the global changes and decline in manufacturing that put men at risk from unemployment, as well as ethnic minorities, although they also have to contend with issues of discrimination which place them at an even higher risk.
Overall this shows that the global changes, technological advances and government policies in the 1970s put certain groups of people at risk, and they were especially vulnerable to unemployment.
The publication of The Bell Curve in 1994, the issues it discussed and conclusions it drew have triggered an enormous controversy over the years after its publication (Keenan 1999).
This comes mostly from its assumed political incorrectness, claimed implications for public policy, and doubts from the scientific community as to its scientific claims (Keenan 1999).
In this essay I shall attempt to take a closer look at some sociologically significant conclusions reached in the book.
It seems, however, impossible to review the book without references to the sharp criticism it sparked upon publication.
I shall therefore occasionally refer to critics or related academic work.
The book sets out in an ambitious tone.
In its introductory note, the authors forebode sensational conclusions, expecting 'that many people will have a "This can't possibly be true" reaction' (p. xix).
It soon becomes clear that the book is intended for a wide audience, and throughout the book the authors continually insinuate this presumption.
It is a point that is well worth noting, as we shall later see.
The intention of the book, however, is not very clear at the outset.
Vague notions such as 'for the last thirty years, the concept of intelligence has been the pariah in the world of ideas' (p. 1), and further, 'received wisdom in the media is roughly 180 degrees opposite from each of the six points [that we assume as a basis]' (p. 23) leave the reader with the idea that the authors are to set straight a grave misunderstanding.
The six points which the authors write about are of great importance throughout the book.
They are six assumptions from the classicist school about intelligence (or cognitive ability, two terms that are used interchangeably in the book) and the place IQ testing takes in expressing a person's intelligence.
Especially claim five and six, respectively, that properly administered IQ tests are not biased, and that intelligence is 'substantially heritable [...] no less that 40 percent and no more than 80 percent' (p. 23) are facts that the authors lean on particularly heavily.
According to critics, the problem is that these claims involve more complication and nuance than an average reader may understand, and that the consensus among psychometricians that the authors mention is not as broad as their own claims.
A critic of the book, professor in psychology Robert Sternberg reacts as follows: 'I think that there is definitely some heritability of intelligence in the White population.
Almost every psychologist believes there is some heritability of IQ and I agree.
But the public may not understand just what that means.
If you accept the use of the heritability statistic, about .5 [50%] is probably right' (Miele 1995).
Throughout the book, moderate claims moulded into more radical views and outcomes are commonplace.
This becomes especially controversial and fragile as topics around intelligence difference between races are being discussed (Frisby 1995).
The virulent attack on the most controversial matters discussed in the book, according to Murray, 'often read like an unintentional confirmation of our view of the "cognitive elite" as a new caste', while 'when the Sturm und Drang has subsided, nothing important in The Bell Curve will have been overturned.
I say this not because Herrnstein and I were especially far-sighted, but because our conclusions are so cautiously phrased and our findings anchored so securely in the middle of the scientific road' (Upstream).
To put these claims in context, it is necessary to look at some of the criticism of the book.
The Bell Curve has been accused of presenting conclusions on a pseudo-scientific basis.
As the book is quite substantial, and the authors continually moderate the argument besides cross-referencing chapters, it is difficult to either speak completely for or against the type of science that The Bell Curve presents the reader with.
However, the idea that Sternberg brings up is worth noting.
He says: 'The way that book is written is to, I think, say X on page 605 in sentence 8, with an appropriate caution, and then invite the reader to a somewhat more extreme conclusion elsewhere' (Miele 1995).
In line with this claim, we find the authors introducing the idea of a possible constant deviation in intelligence between ethnic groups in a casual way: 'Americans have watched the spectacular economic success of the Pacific rim nations' (p. 272), as if this were a logical consequence of a population's higher IQ average.
In the unfolding chapter 13, which deals with variations of cognitive ability between ethnic groups, the book continues to provide the evidence for trends in intelligence difference between 'Asians' and 'Whites'.
For this evidence, the book leans heavily upon the work of Lynn.
A key claim, that IQ differences in the results are not generally found in culturally biased assignments, is here backed by only one source, Jensen.
The work of this scholar, however, is certainly not uncontroversial and may even be racially motivated (Keenan 1999).
Thus, where Murray and Herrnstein claim that 'there is no longer an important technical debate' (p. 282), Sternberg counters: 'To the extent that there is a consensus it is certainly not Herrnstein's and Murray's' (Miele 1995).
Nonetheless, it is no more than fair to put forward Murray's response in the afterword of the book: 'Never mind that The Bell Curve draws its evidence from more than a thousand scholars.
Never mind that among [the accused scholars] are some of the most respected psychologists of our time' (p. 564).
Possibly the complication with the data used lies not so much in its collectors as in the theory behind it.
In order to further their argument, the authors take a great and careless leap beyond their use of the concepts of 'race' and 'ethnicity', concepts which, according to Frisby, are 'best left to specialists' (Frisby 1995), while a UNESCO report argues that 'The term [race] at best is at present time not really allowable on any score in man' (Miles 1982).
How then do the authors of The Bell Curve justify their use of ethnicity (which, again, may be taken as interchangeable in the book)?
Only a paragraph seems enough: 'The studies of "blacks" or "Latinos" or "Asians" who live in America generally denote people who say they are black, Latino or Asian - no more, no less' (p. 271), and further they write 'race differences are varied and complex - and they make the human species more adaptable and more interesting' (p. 272).
In this way, the authors appear to draw a direct connection between personally perceived ethnic differences and the distribution of cognitive abilities for different human groupings.
It can, however, conversely be argued that, like all over the world humans are expected to be born with two arms and two legs, the distribution of intelligence may be expected to fit into a similar predictable model worldwide.
Opinions are still so divided about the issue that different conclusions are reached from the same data.
As an example, the conclusions of Flynn are refuted by the authors as follows: 'He also says that Asian-Americans actually have the same non-verbal intelligence as whites', but 'Lynn disagrees and concludes from the same data [my italics] that there is an ethnic difference in overall IQ as well' (p. 273).
Perhaps the contrast cannot be presented starker than through the following example.
Whilst the authors argue that 'tests results are matched by analyses of occupational and scientific attainment by Jews, which consistently show their disproportionate level of success' (p.275), Keenan (1999) insists: 'The Jews provide another example of the blending of racial distinctions.
They are all presumably derived from one population [...] Gene frequency studies, however, show that now Jewish populations in different parts of the world tend to resemble their surrounding populations at least as much, if not more, than they do each other'.
The book consists of four parts comprising some 500 pages of textual body and several appendices providing more background.
Part III, nonetheless, presents the most important and controversial findings.
The authors recognise this, claiming, 'that many readers have turned first to this chapter indicates how sensitive the issue has become' (p. 270).
It is difficult to accuse the authors of racist motives.
Placing possibly controversial outcomes into a thought exercise, the authors state 'some people would interpret the news as a license for treating all whites as intellectually superior to all blacks [but it becomes] obvious how illogical [...] such reactions would be' (p. 312).
It can, however, easily be said that the authors jump to conclusions about racial differences too soon, to go on suggesting changes in public policy in part IV.
The problem with this book thus lies with its scientific inconsistency.
It sets out with no clearly stated objective, while the use of scholarly caution and polite integrity is broken soon after the authors bring it up.
While the authors promise in the introduction to 'employ the more neutral term cognitive ability as often as possible' (p. 22), synonyms such as 'smart' (p. 127), 'very smart...
Very dumb...' (p. 133) that occasionally crop up nearly indicate the carelessness with which the authors draw their conclusions.
Frisby claims that 'to parade facts about racial differences before the general public is akin to putting a lit match to gasoline' (Frisby 1995).
The authors of The Bell Curve are eager to draw conclusions and that it is what lends this work its importance, but also its legions of hostile critics.
In the words of Sternberg: 'If you were to ask, "What inference do Herrnstein and Murray invite their readers to draw?"
they go beyond what they know' (Miele 1995).
On Friday afternoon, the 26 th of November, I conducted my ethnographic observation in an urban setting in the centre of Leamington.
My first intention was to observe activity and interaction in a second hand book shop, paying special attention to variables such as gender and age, and their potential relation to areas of interest.
This, as we will see, proved to be difficult.
Also, I intended to record noteworthy or unusual behaviour that might be caused by social circumstances particular to the shop.
Around 1.45 pm I entered the shop, and at that moment there were about three customers around, apart from the two shopkeepers.
The shop, called Portland Books has an authentic and old-fashioned atmosphere, with its wooden floor, narrow space and antique, hardback books on old wooden shelves.
Besides old and new books, the shop also sells postcards and old placard photos.
The counter is situated downstairs, in the middle of the shop.
A small staircase leads to a first floor, where a small room with academic literature and a big room with novels and poetry can be found.
I decided to stay upstairs for a while.
In the big room, there were two customers, besides me and a friend that I had brought along.
The upstairs area creates a lesser degree of constraint, as there is no shopkeeper around and the street can not be seen.
This might create a more closed-off environment.
Still, the customers whispered, as would have been the case in a library.
After a while, the low number of customers made it pointless to stay in the shop for very long because of the absence of interaction to observe.
At 2.15 pm I decided to change my approach and find another shop with more people in it.
I found a better case study in another book store called Waterstone's, a bigger shop that sells more mainstream literature and does not offer second-hand books.
Additionally, Waterstone's is situation more centrally at the entrance of a shopping centre and near to the Parade.
Here I spent around two hours observing the shopping public.
Although also not very busy, Waterstone's is a quite big store, like the first shop with two floors, and there was interesting material for observation.
Most of the interaction was situated around the counter, where there was constant conversation between customers and one of the many members of the shop's personnel.
The atmosphere in the shop is of the style of a 'walk-in shopping centre'.
Many people come in to look around briefly, and nearly everybody does this by themselves.
The counter downstairs is placed in the middle of the shop, presumably to make it easier for the personnel to make sure no theft takes place.
Classical music sounds throughout the store; not the type of sensitive piano music, but rather dynamic orchestra music.
However, the music is played quite softly, so that I observed no noticeable response to the music of customers or personnel.
A large stairway leads the way the store's first floor.
This floor is even larger than the ground floor.
Differently from the first shop I visited, this floor also has a counter which is located centrally.
Although there appears to be less constraint (which might be due to the size of the store, and to the music, creating a more 'informal' atmosphere) customers among each other still spoke in a lowered tone.
Again, only around the counter people spoke aloud.
It is striking that, although there was a considerable number of people on this floor (around 30 of more), by far the greatest number of them seemed to have come alone, or at least went around very individually.
The customers also spread out quite evenly over the available sections of books (categorised in sections such as 'history', 'pets', 'linguistics', 'biography' etc.
), most of the time seemingly avoiding sections where other people were looking for books.
Sometimes two people entered the shop together, although throughout the whole period of observation I did not see a larger group of customers entering the shop.
Upon entering, a pair usually split to find the books of their own interest, and hardly interacted until the shop visit was ending.
As such, it can be said that I observed a fairly static social atmosphere in the shop.
It appeared that people were trying to pretend that others were not around them, or influencing their preferred method of going around the shop.
When I observed this aspect, I decided to test to what extent a reaction could be caused among customers by intruding their private sphere.
I went to stand next to a woman in a corner of the shop, to see if this would disturb her private sphere, and thus change her course of activity, or behaviour.
But, although I stood next to her for a while (pretending to look for books), and took books from the shelf she was looking at, she did not react to my presence at all.
Even if my presence did irritate her or created some form of discomfort, she was able to conceal this.
In another instance, I approached a shelf where two people stood in search for books, without speaking.
Although I stood behind them for a while, looking at the shelves they stood in front of, they did not react to this.
Whether it happens consciously or not, most of the customers conform to seclusion of each individual.
I would even argue that a quiet consensus exists to uphold a sort of polite distance, seemingly dependent on consciously avoiding each other, after which the customer does not have to assess constantly the situation in which it is appropriate to react to others.
This, of course, creates the somewhat silent and static atmosphere of which I spoke earlier.
About the type of people, I can say the following.
On the first floor, there was a majority of women among the customers.
Most of them I guessed were over forty years of age.
Interestingly, between the two floors there seemed to be something of a difference between the types of customers.
Generally, customers downstairs were younger of age, and they spent less time in the shop.
Moreover, the customers downstairs seemed to be more reactive to other customers.
They seemed, perhaps, less accustomed to the unwritten rules of the 'bookshop etiquette'.
What underlines this mode of thinking, also, is the method of classifying the books it offers.
Children's books, bestsellers, as well as popular scientific books, are all on offer on the ground floor, while some books were displayed on tables on the ground floor, as well as on shelves at the top floor.
Although at first it may appear inefficient and chaotic to place one book in two places in the store, we must look for an explanation to it.
It may be presumed that Waterstone's has deliberately implemented a categorisation of books that suits its customers and therefore works effectively as the most profitable way of advertising its books.
Whereas regular bookshop visitors have certain sections of books they might be most interested in (particularly specialist literature qualifies for this, as people interested in one type of book are likely to buy more books of that type), others might be on the outlook for a particular book they have been recommended, or in search of a suitable gift.
An average customer at Waterstone's is therefore likely to come to the store with an idea of what to buy.
The store then tries to cater for any type of customer, so that they might easily find what they are looking for if they have no idea what to buy, or in the second case, may look around undisturbed for books of their interest.
It is furthermore interesting to note that the store succeeds to a high degree to create an optimal consumer atmosphere.
There is little talking, people who intend to stay for a longer period easily find their way in search for their category of books, and the first floor, by concealing the street and placing the salon tables and couch, create an atmosphere where people can stay longer without being disturbed.
It is likely that the customers recognise and reinforce aspects of this way of thinking.
This is shown by the fact that people search for books by themselves, even if they enter the shop as part of a group.
Other evidence is the maintenance of the 'polite distance' of which I spoke earlier.
It is evident that consumerism decides to a high degree what forms of social interaction are accepted, and which not.
In this, there is no great difference of interest between personnel and customer.
The nineteenth century was, until recently, predominantly seen as a century of rapid industrialisation which set the stage for profound social change.
This way of thinking about the birth of a capitalist society, however, fails to recognise the two sides to the changes that took place.
After all, not only was there rapid increase in supply, also was demand of consumer goods ever increasing (McCracken 1990:5).
Earlier examples of cultural consumerism in various forms of frequent local gift exchange could already be found in the late eighteenth-century (Finn 2000:143).
However, consumerism in the Victorian period took a different and much more broad-based shape through various agents, of which most importantly department stores and an 'unparalleled advertising craze' (Loeb 1994:5).
And while men in the eighteenth-century were themselves participating consumers in an informal, pre-capitalist local economy, in the last decades of the nineteenth century mass advertisement of an impersonal character began to target almost only women as their potential customers (Loeb 1994:8) in a highly formalised mass commercial economy.
The departure from a semi-formal, local economy to this increasingly enlarged scale of consumption of various kinds of consumer goods did not occur without protest or debate (Rappaport 1996).
By the 1850s, the middle class had come to project a self-image of a virtuous class, with an identity based upon plainness and self-discipline.
Especially into the nineteenth century, as the middle class began to emerge as a distinctive class, emphasised and luxurious clothing were replaced by more austere and sober dress (Finn 2000).
Indeed sobriety and democratic value formed part of its claim to political power.
But after the great wave of revolutions, from which middle class all over Europe once again arose reaffirmed in their political position, these democratic values came to be reinterpreted (Loeb 1994), slowly replacing sobriety for the desired acquisition of an 'ornamental delirium' for members of the middle class and the world that surrounded them (McCracken 1990:24).
Perhaps the Great Exhibition of 1851 may be said to have served as a starting point of the spread of consumerism.
Upon its opening in the Crystal Palace in London, it attracted a recorded total of six million visitors, equal to one-third of the country's population (Weintraub 2004).
Moreover, for the first time, 'ordinary commodities [were turned] into cultural signifiers' (Rappaport 1996:65), affirming the results of a rational and sober life.
Also William Whiteley, owner of London's first department store, had seen the Crystal Palace, and desired to open a store that made available those goods that remained unattainable at the Great Exhibition (Rappaport 1996).
The decades after 1851 then set the stage for an ambiguous public debate among the middle classes, in which critics of new department stores such as Whiteley's expressed 'fears about the morality of consumption' (Rappaport 1996:66), while on the other side a nearly fantastic range of new goods and unprecedented luxury and comfort triggered a great appraisal of 'material democracy' (Loeb 1994:7).
McCracken has argued that this middle class tendency toward mass consumerism represented a 'fundamental shift in the culture of the [...] modern world' (McCracken 1990:3) in which the middle class increasingly defined itself in material terms, while within its body others based their elitist or democratic values upon a paraphernalia of objects symbolically highly charged.
Initially, the growing number of middle class women engaging themselves in the pastime of shopping was a sight that conflicted with the traditional Victorian 'angel in the household'.
While some critics despised the idea of women drinking liquor during such shopping trips to the department store, others went even further to compare these consuming women with prostitutes (Finn 1998:36).
In this criticism we may find a fear that was both classed and gendered; after all, prostitutes represented a disrupting female working class challenge to middle class Victorian idea of the gentile, meek and submissive wife.
Shopping, however, remained viewed and actively gendered as a feminine task (Loeb 1994:12, Rappaport 1996:67) and the role of middle class women became increasingly an ornamental one.
In the streets of London, 'Female shoppers, like the glittering objects on display, became a central part of the urban spectacle' (Rappaport 1996:80), allowing them to become walking statements, sometimes of middle class democratising success at large, other times drawing from an individualistic elitist identity (McCracken 1990).
Advertisement did not play the least role in this newly constructed female middle class identity.
From an early point, advertisers came to accept that 'the hand that rocks the cradle is the hand that buys the boots' (Loeb 1994:8).
Throughout the second half of the nineteenth century, techniques of persuasion became increasingly refined (McCracken 1990:29), shifting the portrayal of the household mistress in a shape of the 'perfect lady' through images in an often historical, near-mythological style (Loeb 1994).
Such portrayal of rather powerful, controlling women attempted to equal the act of shopping to having 'the opportunity to', as a critic wrote disdainfully, '"luxuriate" in a deep and intense "sense of power"' (Rappaport 1996:76).
Growing consumerism, besides reforming the gender ideal, was also championed as a new definition of class difference.
As goods on sale in the department store increasingly became 'material symbols', which set prescriptions of how the middle class was to dress, what material conveniences they could posses, which, in turn said something about 'how they should spend their leisure time' (McCracken 1990:27).
Businesses and advertisers were eager to support this civilising, 'rational' view on middle class consumption.
Their profits came mostly from the middle class, as a journal of the trade wrote: 'The buyers of the world are the great MIDDLE CLASS PEOPLE [sic]' (Loeb 1994:8).
Thus, the Army and Navy Co-operative Society, a private department store, instructed the doorkeepers to keep servants and messengers out to avoid class mingling and provide safety for the female audience (Rappaport 1996).
On the other hand, products that served to define middle class status were sold as necessities through the creation of great fear.
Parents read in advertisements that without Mellin's Food, their child '[would] not last long' (Loeb 1994:14), while "Raw Milk" was advertised as so dangerous, that 'those who allow it to be served to their families take a great responsibility' (Loeb 1994:14).
The arousal of fear can be said to have been used in advertisement and by the department stores in reaffirming middle class values through consumption, for which shopping could comfortably be conducted in the safe, exclusive environment of the department store.
As mentioned earlier, this image of the safe middle class 'Universal Provider' taking care of you 'from the cradle to the grave' (Rappaport 1996:73) was continually criticised.
Opponents of Whiteley's business tried to 'expose' the degenerate consumption behaviours of his customers (Rappaport: 1996:61), while hyperboloid advertisement was often dismissed as 'puffery' by its audience (Loeb 1994:5).
Moreover, small shopkeepers tried to stand in the way of business men such as Whiteley whenever they could (Rappaport 1996).
However, such opposition was overcome in various ways.
First of all, great businesses such as Whiteley's received continual impulses through the middle class desire to attain novelties aroused by mass advertisement in periodicals of all kinds.
Even as the country slid into an economical recession in the 1870s, the middle class 'seemed determined to perpetuate an invigorating sense of material possibility' (Loeb 1994:3).
Objections to a valueless, banal middle class were diverted by the emergence of the eccentric, elitist model of the dandy, who, by claims of superior aesthetic standards created a new elite from within the middle class (McCracken 1990).
Retailers with shops around department stores came to take these stores for a fact.
It was soon found that, if the neighbourhood cooperated with the department store, markets expanded handsomely, also for smaller retailers (Rappaport 1996).
Eventually, by the end of the nineteenth century all criticism had been channelled into the new consumerist middle class model.
Except, perhaps, for some moral criticism, which was labelled as old-fashioned (Rappaport 1996).
Consumption in the nineteenth century was nothing new (McCracken 1990).
However, its extent and the way in which it changed the middle class was an enormous step further toward the modern capitalist model as we know it today.
Where before the Victorian era consumption remained limited to a small number, it now took a flight to mass proportions.
The way in which the public came to see the department store was transformed 'from "the halls of temptation" into a recognised and cherished "social sight"' (Rappaport 1996:61).
Whereas social changes and higher living standards were previously seen as the result of industrialisation and the great increase of supply of a wide range of goods, the driving forces on the 'demand side' are now becoming increasingly appreciated and researched (McCracken 1990).
One of the reasons for this enormous increase in consumption may be found in the fact that new markets were sought to create a demand for this surplus of goods (Rappaport 1996:81).
However, this does not tell the entire story.
The general enthusiasm with which new material achievements were hailed had a profound effect on society and the way in which the middle class defined itself as part of it.
Also men, and more particularly women within the middle class were both changed and changed their identities consciously with increasing consumerism.
As 'shopping' was essentially gendered as a female activity in the second half of the nineteenth century, changes of gender perception were most acutely visible with women.
Women were now encouraged to beautify themselves and surround their middle class homes with a paraphernalia of gentility.
At the eve of the Versailles conference, promoters of the Polish cause immediately realised the international precariousness of their aims to forge the rebirth of an independent Polish state.
Moving with caution, Piłsudski, Head of State and Supreme Commander of the Polish troops, in December 1918 even went as far as addressing his archrival Dmowski of the Polish National Committee in Paris as 'My Dear Roman' in an attempt to reconcile the Polish feuding factions.
From the outset, it appeared that Poland's independence 'would depend almost exclusively on the endeavours of the Poles themselves', however, soon after the official acknowledgement of Poland's Second Republic, the political struggle grew bitter.
It was only the realisation of Soviet hostility toward their new western neighbour that forced the antagonistic political forces to work together in a somewhat efficient war cabinet, though even then with the greatest difficulty and resentment.
At nearly the same time that peace was concluded with the Russians in the Treaty of Riga, the endeks, as Dmowski's National Democrats popularly came to be know, managed to pass an overly liberal constitution which left virtually no freedom to the president of the new Polish Republic and much procedural liberty with the endek-dominated parliament.
It was immediately recognised as 'a monument to anti- Piłsudskiism', and left Piłsudski bereft of a meaningful role within Polish politics, despite his nationwide fame as Poland's liberator gained through his successful military operations against the Soviet troops in the war of 1919-21.
The seed was thus planted for Piłsudski's initial decision to overthrow the government in 1926 by the National Democrats' uncompromising political attitude and wish for political domination.
While the direct cause for Piłsudski's coup d'etat can be said to have sprung from his 'personal ambition and intolerance', and obsession 'with the idea of Poland's unity and greatness', it must be added that Piłsudski's frustrations were partly validated by the sheer incapability of the multitude of Polish governments quickly succeeding each other of dealing with a great number of urgent and pressing matters.
Thus, the reasons for the collapse of parliamentary democracy in Poland and the subsequent usurpation of power by the Nazi aggressors thereafter can be brought back to a number of reasons, of which Poland's 'own fundamental weaknesses, the instability of its institutions, and its irresponsible governments, as well as to the active and passive faults of the Great Powers' are the most important and general ones.

</fnote>The list of problems and grievances that the young Polish state was thrust into from the early twenties was indeed impressive.
While basic issues, such as the development of a political system and the role of minorities in the new state still had to be addressed, Poland was first confronted with 'a veritable fight for survival'.

</fnote>National unity was far to be sought.
The dominion claimed by Poland included vast numbers of minorities with loyalties elsewhere.
Of twenty-seven million inhabitants not even 70 per cent were Polish, while 14.3 per cent were of other Slavic decent and 7.8 per cent of the population were Jewish, often not speaking Polish and many opposed to the establishment of a Polish nation.
The same went for the small German minority of 3.9 per cent, whom, by conducing themselves 'in manner that was at once provocative and calculated to give notice that it regarded its status in Poland, and Poland herself, as temporary', outraged the Polish majority.
A long struggle between Poland and her minorities persisted throughout the interbellum period.
While it has been noted that '[n]othing the Poles did was ever right, as far as [the Jews] were concerned', there was little effort on the government's side to draw the Jews into appreciated and meaningful participation of national life.
On the contrary, when Poland's first president, Gabriel Narutowicz, came to be elected with support of the bloc of minority parties, he was murdered within days after his election by the Sejm.
Despite the endeks' initial condemnation of the murderer, whom saw the election of a minority-dependent president as a 'symbol of shame', he was later celebrated as a Polish nationalistic hero.
Generally, the antagonistic sense existed, in which when the minorities, with the little representation they had in parliament, exercised their rightful power, it was seen as invalid and unjustified by a wide range of centre-right and rightist Polonocentric parties, thus blocking the way for meaningful political participation of the minorities.

</fnote>While, to some degree, all political factions agreed with Piłsudski's insistence on 'complete independence for Poland, [...] sceptical of the value of co-operation with any Russians', little was done to involve the Ukranian and Belorussian minorities in decision-making of their lot, even though Poland's border with Russia came to run 'far to the east of that originally suggested by Lord Curzon' during the Versailles conference.
Piłsudski's ideal of a federal model incorporating largely autonomous minority factions were soon defeated; instead there existed 'acrimony and distrust, a sort of internal war'.
Moreover, while the minorities did little to contribute to a 'modus vivendi', a sense of community spirit, which might have brought more peaceful social relations, many Poles themselves were unrealistic and intolerant about the formal and informal shape Polish society must take.
This had not only racial, but also religious, economic and political reasons.
Pre-war conditions of many Poles created a resentful attitude toward minorities and this made it hard to deal with the minorities in a fair way.

</fnote>Politically and economically antagonistic views were from the onset a mutually enforcing problem, which caused great obstacles for the creation of a healthily functioning government.
Additionally, the multitude of Polish independence parties which had formerly existed, maintained their air of secrecy and 'conspiratorial character' even when government bodies had been created, which had disastrous results in the conflict between Dmowski and Piłsudski, which took its toll on Poland's national interest.
The passing of an overly liberal constitution based on that of France at the end of the Polish-Russian war in 1921 resulted in extreme factionism; by 1926, there existed more than 90 parties, of which around 30 parties were at times represented in the Sejm.
As parliament held most power within the political structure, governments found it very difficult to pass reforms.
The economy, in particular, proved a disastrously antagonising force.
Extreme inflation, such as in Warsaw, where food prices with a unitary value of "100" in January 1921 rose to "1298.2" in December 1922, brought several governments to fall, while rising unemployment caused the Polish Socialist Party, the PPS, to organise strikes throughout 1924 and 1925.
Dmowski and his endecja became increasingly entangled in their bid for power.
While land reform was the way out for a country too poor to introduce any significantly contributing industrialisation, the National Democrats, with many landowning members, were reluctant to land redistribution of any real importance, which in turn caused the anomosity of the peasant parties.
This, in all, caused land reforms to be rather ineffective and certainly insufficient.
A sense of lingering problems thus left a general discontent throughout all layers of society.

</fnote>Additional to internal problems, came the issue of Poland's national security.
Weimar Germany continued a revisionist policy of regaining its former Prussian areas and southeastern Silesia from Poland.
This caused a particular as Poland had no natural defensive barrier and the western powers, although they ratified Poland's borders to the east,  took little affirmative action against Germany's revisionist campaign, which lent its support to Germans in Poznania and Pomerania in a number of ways, thus destabilising the nation through what was essentially a very small percentage of its population.

</fnote>Another form of support to the new independent state which was pressingly lacking was financial aid.
Having half of its roads, railways and public buildings destroyed during the Great War, and a continuing expenditure of over 50 per cent of the state budget on defense and the railway system, the government lacked the essential funds to modernise industry and thus create employment.
The absence of foreign loans and apparent disinterest in creating political stability from the western powers might have done much to help Poland establish a parliamentary democratic routine.
Thus, when the British foreign office sneeringly contradicted the Soviet Union's allegation of involvement in Piłsudksi's coup d'etat in a telegram to its ambassador in Moscow, arguing that '[the Russians] are of less consequence to us than they suppose', this revealed much of its indifferent attitude towards Polish politics as well.

</fnote>The exigent situation that Poland was in did not go unnoticed.
Piłsudksi, embittered by the course of events since 1921, grew increasingly convinced that Polish 'parliamentarianism had [...] opened the door to general corruption'.
But not just Piłsudksi was displeased with the situation.
Much of the PPS-cadre, frustrated with years of ineffective government and endek domination, now turned their hopes to Piłsudksi, which prompted PPS theorist Feliks Perl to foreshadowingly argue in 1924: 'He cannot be made into a left-wing Mussolini'.
PPS leader Daszyński argued that political immaturity of the state was the main cause for political feuding, but, in the beginning of 1926, also urged for immediate constitutional reforms empowering the presidential post in order to contain parliamentary quarreling.

</fnote>Not just the opposition of the left had their second thoughts about the functioning of the state.
In December 1925, Dmowski wrote 'if we could create even half the organization like the Fascists...
I would willingly agree to a dictatorship in Poland'.
Discontents with the democratic procedure and democracy as such proved different degrees of the same slippery slope, as it soon turned out.
University students radicalised under the prospect of unemployment and resented the apparent greater success of their Jewish peers; they formed the leadership of fascist movements that were to increase their power-base throughout the 1930s.

</fnote>Overwhelmed by problems of such dimensions, historians have argued, 'some action [...] seems in retrospect to have been almost inevitable' within the Polish political landscape.
This seems, however, an unlikely viewpoint and it is worthwhile considering what other course of events politics might have taken.
An internal conflict in Piłsudski's course of action appears quite clearly, as when in November 1925, when Piłsudski is requested to take over the rule of the country by factions of the army.
He claimed he 'would never be a cause of trouble and dissention in the State'.
It seems, from this, to have been rather a passionate, naturalistic sense of justice that drove him to carry out the coup d'etat than a positivistic, legal course of action.
Already earlier in the twenties had Piłsudski shown this duality in his character.
By declining a bid for the presidency, he proudly refused 'to be enclosed in a 'gilded cage'', while apparently seeing no value in attempting reforms through coalition in the Sejm.
Rather than acknowledging his objections to National Democratic domination, he slid further back into the trappings of "moral dictatorship", hereby only united the body politic in their opposition against his rule.
Thus, the peasant parties united in the Sejm to resist political persecution, while his own rule alienated moderate supporters of his "parliamentary dictatorship".
While open confrontation with the initially supportive socialists became ever more discernible, Piłsudski still drew a Hobbesian legitimacy from the backing of the Sejm's members, which became, however, increasingly difficult to forge.
When, in the end of 1929, he personally came to reopen the Sejm accompanied by a hundred armed officers, Daszyński refused to open the session 'under the threat of bayonets, guns and sabres', Piłsudski abstained from openly breaching the constitution by forcefully opening the session.
The failure of Piłsudski's coup must thus been assessed within his own framework of legitimacy, which was to "cleanse" the parliamentary body politic.
'It is the basis of democracy, for which there is always place in Poland', he still argued in 1926.
By late 1930, a number of oppositionist politicians were arrested, held captive and tortured.
When eventually a number of politicians chose exile rather than imprisonment, Piłsudski was as far as ever from his ideal of a federalist republic.
His cabinets governed for months 'simpy by repeatedly adjourning the Sejm'.
Growing older, Piłsudski became an increasingly mistrustful statesman, believing in the last months before his death that 'the nation had reached real unity at last'.
In reality, the new 1935 Constitution 'formally put an end to democracy', calling in a period known as the "rule of the colonels" which incorporated a mixture of nationalism and fascism.

</fnote>By carrying out a coup d'etat, Piłsudski essentially interfered forcefully with the democratic institutions.
While initially hesitant, the sanacja's breeches of the constitution and civil rights were increasingly necessary for Piłsudski to maintain power.
This, however, had detrimental effects on the democratic institutions and increasingly alienated many parts of society from his government.
Being insufficiently successful in curbing further economic regression into the 1930s and failing to integrate increasingly militant groups of minorities, Piłsudski's failures played in the hand of the right, which made a comeback in radical form, while his sanacja leadership was increasingly chosen from a clique of military cronies.
Piłsudski's coup d'etat of 1926 proved, thus, not only to be ineffective on theoretical grounds, but also on practical grounds, eventually breaking with Piłsudski's personal visions on good statesmanship.

</fnote>In negotiating the post-war political landscape of Eastern Europe, the western powers revealed an ambiguous attitude.
Although historians still disagree on whether diplomatic misunderstandings between the allies of the east and west eventually caused the emergence of a cold war, or whether a gradual loss of influence in Eastern European countries was the reason for its outbreak, the half-hearted commitment to their self-proclaimed defense of liberal democratic principles such as democracy and regional stability prompted disillusioned contemporaries to see the allied settlement of Eastern Europe as again one of unprincipled compromise and appeasement.
As former Polish Prime Minister in exile Mikołajczyk wrote a few years later: 'we were sacrificed by our allies, the United States and Great Britain'.

</fnote>Nonetheless, the United States had full intentions to prevent the re-emergence of any great power on the European continent.
The reasons for the western allies' failure to prevent the communisation of Eastern Europe must be sought in the complex and antagonistic diplomatic relations between the two camps of the grand alliance.
Whereas the Soviets mistrusted Anglo-American intentions, Roosevelt believed until the end in the possibility of a peaceful settlement with regard to Soviet claims to "national security" in Eastern Europe.
By pursuing this policy, Roosevelt downplayed the ideological difficulties underlying the matter.
Optimistically, he believed in the compatibility of free and democratic elections in the Soviet Union's neighbouring states, and the natural emergence of 'governments which would maintain friendly relations with the Soviet Union'.
The incompatibility of these two principles caused the Americans to deal with the ideological justification of a possible settlement in somewhat abstract terms, believing a favourable outcome would eventually justify such agreements as the Declaration on Liberated Europe made with the Soviets.
Roosevelt's underestimation of Soviet expansionism ultimately rendered an agreement on Poland made at the Yalta conference 'so elastic that the Russians can stretch it all the way from Yalta to Washington without technically breaking it'.

</fnote>Britain, too, found itself in a difficult moral position between its mid-war pledges to the Polish government that '"His Majesty's Government do not recognize any territorial changes which have been effected in Poland since August, 1939"', and the maintenance of allied unity, which eventually involved some concessions to the Soviet Union as to territorial and political claims in Poland.
The Soviet's insistence on territorial expansion in East Prussia, Bessarabia, northern Bukovina and Ruthenia, besides the incorporation of eastern Poland up to the Curzon line were thereafter verified at Yalta in February 1945 and at Potsdam in July of that year.
Most likely, Churcill's infamous percentages deal with Stalin in October 1944 only reaffirmed Stalin's conviction that he was allowed a free hand in Eastern European territories based merely on unprincipled Realpolitik.
However, opposition to these concessions grew.
Mikołajczyk, who had all along protested 'that we were only asking for a return to the prewar status quo' resigned, while in the United States Senator Arthur Vandenberg, in 1945, 'looked at the Soviet Union through the lens of Poland and did not like what he saw'.
Thus, the Soviet Union and the western powers gradually maneuvered into a bipolar power structure.

</fnote>Despite the apparently systematic usurpation of power in Eastern European countries by the Soviet Union, it must be borne in mind that Stalin hardly foresaw the full course of events.
Often, he acted upon situations as he was confronted with them.
It has, therefore, been argued that 'Stalinisation was a process, not a plan'.
Intrinsically mistrustful, Stalin concealed much of his intentions, convincing the Americans for a long time that the Soviet Union subscribed to a free, unified Europe.
The disparities between open and concealed policy at times took immense and grotesque proportions.
Hence, when the Nazis, in 1943, unveiled a mass grave of 15,000 Polish officers at Katyn, murdered upon Stalin's orders, he denied all allegation and seized the opportunity to break diplomatic relations with the Polish government-in-exile upon inquiries from President Sikorski.
Moreover, the Soviet-sponsored Polish provisional government in Lublin was ordered to break its links with the loyalist Polish underground Home Army (AK).

</fnote>Acting from a conviction that any liberated territory immediately became of concern solely for the liberating nation, Moscow eventually resorted to unilateral action to reinforce its sphere of influence.
However, '[t]he brutality and cynicism with which [Stalin] handled these matters did more than anything to exhaust the goodwill the Soviet war effort had accumulated in the West'.
The replacement of the Radescu government in Romania by the Soviet-supported, communist Groza government, but more strongly, ongoing practices to consolidate Soviet power in Poland in the beginning of 1945 appeared 'to London and Washington deliberately to violate the Yalta agreement'.
Cynicism about the possibility of a settlement with Moscow eventually caused the alliance to break before the end the war.

Toward the end of the war, Moscow, defying the "London Poles", backed the establishment of a new interim government, while between July 1944 and July 1945, Stalin started to build for Poland 'a security apparatus which was already showing disturbing signs of independence from the Polish government and which was, in fact, effectively controlled by the Soviet 'advisers' within it'.

</fnote>In the middle of 1944, however, the Lublin claims to governmental supremacy went by no means uncontested.
The loyalist Home Army was still Poland's largest organised resistance movement, and Stalin, uncertain about the Lublin committee's loyalty, made a separate agreement with another Polish communist faction based in Moscow, the Polish Committee of National Liberation, which he, according to Mikołajczyk, 'had organised earlier as an instrument of his plans for postwar Poland'.
Later that year, the balance of power shifted further in favour of the Soviet Union, by the failing Warsaw uprising, which meant 'the end of the independent Polish left-wing alternative to the Communists'.

</fnote>With the crushing of 'the leadership of the historic political forces and their military infrastructure' in Poland, communisation now became only a matter of time.
In March 1945 the Soviet Union signed a treaty of friendship with Lublin Committee; in the same month a delegation of sixteen prominent politicians, among whom the government delegate of the Polish government in exile, and the commander of the Polish Home Army (Armia Krajowa) were trapped in a meeting and deported to the Soviet Union to face accusations of conspiring against the Red Army.

</fnote>These developments were signs of the establishment of a Polish interim government existing solely by the grace of the Soviet Union.
At this time, however, Poland was still by no means a neatly communised, country, nor was it accepted to be so by the western powers.
The post-war political programmes of the Lublin committee and the Polish Committee of National Liberation still revealed rather divergent political agendas.
Moreover, despite a domination of Lublin committee ministers in the cabinet, the communists still saw a necessity of including oppositionists in the government.
The return to Poland of Mikołajczyk in late 1944 had halted, at least for the time being, an effective total usurpation of the body politic by pro-Soviet communists.
Even by 1946, Mikołajczyk's Polish Peasant Party was, with its 600,000 members, Poland's largest political party.

</fnote><fnote>Crampton, Eastern Europe, pp.
218-9.
</fnote>Up to this point, we have primarily looked at the situation in Poland, which, for many western politicians, had become 'the test case of Soviet intentions'.
Nevertheless, the communisation of other Eastern European countries happened quite differently, depending on the internal political situation as well as the national state of affairs in the international context at the close of the war.
A basis for further negotiation was laid in October 1944 with Churchill's percentages deal with Stalin, in which, among other things, the balance of influence in Yugoslavia was to be divided on a fifty-fifty basis.
However, too much has been made of these negotiations.
As has been pointed out, in discussions following up on these divisions, British and Soviet foreign ministers Eden and Molotov were unable to reach an eventual agreement which satisfied both demands.
As mentioned before, Stalin saw communisation much as a process of opportunities, and in Yugoslavia, the influence of Moscow was 'paramount from the outset'.
Paradoxically, however, it was Stalin's caution to avoid alarming the western powers that saw the construction of a compromise government, although on favourable terms for the Yugoslavian communists.
In March 1945, an acting regency was agreed, consisting of 'three members, one Croat, one Serb, and one Slovene [who], though non-communists, were all nominees of Tito'.
Stalin even managed to convince Churchill to add British support to Tito's provisional government, despite its earlier overt hostilities to 'the English imperialists' back in 1941.
The British support helped the Yugoslavian communists to strengthen their power base at the expense of the exile government.
With the help of the Red Army, they 'dispersed, disarmed, or forced the exodus of Mihailović's forces from Serbia', thus gaining access to actual power in the body politic.
Moreover, 'the communists, though they might share government [in a coalition], would not share power'.
Although it was now 'but a short step to the formalisation of the communist takeover', this meant by no means that this happened firmly under Stalin's direction.
The Red Army had retreated from Yugoslavian territory, and Tito, though deferential to Stalin, 'had formed views of his own and had no hesitation in expressing them, even when they contradicted those of Stalin himself'.

</fnote>The postwar Czechoslovak dealings with the Soviet Union were quite different.
Although it has been argued that 'Stalin as well as Roosevelt and Churchill miscalculated when they assumed that there could be friendly states along an expanded Soviet periphery', Czech leader in exile Beneš certainly tried, and temporarily managed, to come to some agreement with the Soviet Union.
He 'spoke openly of a "Czech solution" that would exchange internal autonomy for Soviet control over foreign and military policy'.
Beneš was not unjustified in his calculations of the postwar situation in the area.
Although Churchill had repeatedly argued for a speeded advance eastwards beyond the western zone of occupation to liberate Prague and prevent Czechoslovakia from falling within the Soviet sphere of influence, general Eisenhower declined, arguing that he 'refused to risk casualties for 'purely political reasons''.
Directly upon the liberation of Prague in early May, Soviet interests were secured.
The communists within the country were thereafter 'in a strong position for a seizure of power', but Stalin told their leader Gottwald to '"work with Beneš, reach an agreement with him, accept him as president."'.
Fearing that an immediate communist takeover would only work counterproductively by concentrating anti-communist factions around the democratic person of Beneš, they decided to negotiate the terms of a new government on a broader base until the right time would appear to assume power.
Beneš, from his side, hoped that the inclusion of communist factions in the cabinet would result in a strengthened democratic system, 'with the blessing of the Soviet Union'.

</fnote>This policy turned out to be only one of buying time.
Despite the relative moderateness and tolerance of Gottwald's communists, the Soviet Union continued to press for further advances to communisation.
Due to an initial underestimation of Soviet interests in Czechoslovakia by the Americans, the military means of interference were lost when the communists eventually seized power in 1948 without any direct justification.

</fnote>The various examples of Eastern European reveal a diverse range of political situations in the period running up to May 1945.
In the Polish case, Stalin's hopes for a post-war accommodation with the Sikorski government were abandoned already in 1942, while in the Czechoslovak case, Beneš' immense popularity prevented the Soviets from bluntly by-passing its exiled government.
The Yugoslavian situation was yet different, with a political climate in which the communist party directly and almost naturally dominated the new government.
Nonetheless, Tito's power of government was not immediately and unconditionally recognised by Moscow, which is telling of Stalin's opportunism in his efforts to shape Eastern Europe into a system in which communisation dominated.

</fnote>Meanwhile, goodwill for Soviet intentions in the west gradually deteriorated until the alliance eventually collapsed.
A turning point in Soviet diplomacy directed toward the west can be noted around March and April 1945, while an increasing number of American liberals were becoming disenchanted with the Soviet Union and its attitude.
After an initial willingness to cooperate, a number of unbridgeable disagreements increasingly turned Soviet-Western relations into an ideological conflict, epitomised by Trumans words to Molotov in their first meeting, 'Carry out your agreements and you won't get talked to like that'.

</fnote>May 1945 saw the beginnings of a realisation that Soviet unilateral activities in Eastern Europe had to be confronted.
However, whilst Stalin had already been active with his communisation plans as territories were being liberated, the Truman administration still resisted the harsher anti-Soviet line held by the British around May 1945.
The communisation of Eastern Europe happened step by step; yet most countries, in May 1945, faced a deteriorating, yet not hopeless democratic climate, with strong oppositions counterweighing against communist aspirations.
The late recognition and reluctance to take responsibility of the Americans may thus have been the deciding factor in the eventual communisation of the countries in Eastern Europe.

</fnote>While it is certain that the reformation which set off in the twenties of the fifteenth century was preceded by more than a century of humanism challenging, among other things, man's attitude toward theological issues, the extent and influence of the humanist movement are still a matter of debate.
While it has been asserted that humanist thought centred around the capabilities of the human as gifts of God, as opposed to the middle age view of man as 'a humble, fallen creature under the permanent curse of original sin', the unity of the humanist agenda has to a large extent been exaggerated, and the various strands of humanism across Europe 'do not appear to have adopted a coherent position on matters of substance'.
What does emerge upon careful assessment, though, is a general set of new attitudes and principles, often contrasting those of the medieval scholastic movement which is shared by both the humanist and reformer.
Moreover, a careful assessment of the general theological position inherent in most of humanist thought must be contrasted to that of the reformers' movement to come to a fuller appreciation of how humanism came to influence reforming thought and vice versa.

</fnote>The coming of humanism to Germany virtually coincided with the founding of the first German university in Prague.
Indeed, the establishment of universities brought a fresh outlook to the studies of theology and morals, entrenching the humanist tradition (studia humanitatis) ever firmer into German scholarly attitudes.
By the beginning of the sixteenth century, sixteen university had been founded across the German lands, which in various degrees pursued the methods of a new kind of studies.
Professors of the studia humanitatis stressed text-based studies, thereby aiming to gain powerful and valuable insights of Christian religion brought back to a purer interpretation of the biblical text.
Their slogan ad fontes signified, most importantly, an attempt to get closer to the true intention of the scriptures.
Moreover, the via moderna, as this new interpretation of religion came to be called, also challenged the minutely derived rationalist viewpoints of medieval theologians (known as the via antiqua) by stressing the value of human experience and interpretation.
For example, the German philologist and humanist Rudolf Agricola sought to explore this in his writing.
Thus, he came to assert: 'Prodigious, immense, and unbelievable is the power of the human mind'.
A renewed strong interest with secular Latin and Greek authors derived directly from the humanists' concern with the reform of language into clear uncomplicated formulations so as to arrive at more logical conclusions.
Such linguistic reform the humanists found through 'the observation and imitation of the best authors and writers', classics such as 'Virgil, Lucan, Horace [...], Plautus, Terence, Cicero, Sallust, Seneca, and the Roman historian Valerius Maximus'.

</fnote>It goes without saying that, by permitting themselves such a new, revisionist outlook, the northern European humanists soon came to criticise what they considered unjustified behaviour within the church and among all Christians in general, be it while viewing themselves inside the religious order and thus without calling into doubt the authority of the church.
Still, in many respects, humanism undermined the absolute authority of the church organisation, stressing the humble, speculative element of religious life.
Erasmus suitably quoted St. Paul in his work Praise of Folly (1509): 'I speak it not after the Lord, but as it were foolishly'.
<fnote>McGrath, The Intellectual Origins, p. 36.
</fnote><fnote>Desiderius Erasmus, 'Oration: Theological Dispute' in The Praise of Folly,  URL  (1509) </fnote>By the time Luther came in conflict with the church, humanism had become well engendered in Germany.
But besides the Italian humanist influences of text-based study, German humanists furthermore came to incorporate the creation of a distinct German identity in their writing.
Around the turn of the century, several texts were published praising Germany's pious and learned traditions, with at its foundation the rediscovering of Tacitus' Germania in 1455.
It was within this tradition that the greatest reformers received their education.
The studies of Zwingli in Vienna, the Swiss reformer, coincided with the arrival to that city of Conrad Celtis, Germany's poet laureate, while Luther regarded humanist techniques of philology and the close study of the scriptures as the key to his theological discoveries.
Similarly, Calvin, a decade later, would be grounded in the study of bonae litterae.
Yet, the position of the reformers went beyond that of the humanists in theological zeal and single-mindedness.
While most humanists agreed that '[t]he irreducible particularity of human reality was [...] more suited to historical description, rather than logical analysis', they proposed as a solution simply the reform of education through training in rhetoric and the study of 'ancient philosophers, poets and orators', as Celtis argued already in 1492.
The differences in point of view of reformers like Luther and Zwingli initially appeared rather blurred to many humanists, which in effect strengthened their case.
It was this 'productive misunderstanding' which made a great controversy out of Luther's theological uneasy with some of the church's practices.
The theoretical misunderstanding is to some extent no surprise.
Humanists and reformers alike shared many principles which clothed the doctrinal move away from the church in humanist language.
Thus, when Luther wrote of his breakthrough in the theory of justification, that '[h]itherto, this epistle has been smothered with comments and all sorts of irrelevances, yet, in essence, it is a brillant light, almost enough to illuminate the whole bible', this certainly bore the semblance of the humanists' study of the scriptures ad fontes.

</fnote>Historians have argued that '[t]o a certain extent, the reformers were simply confirming the advances made by the Humanist agenda, with its stress on ancient languages, its tools of exegesis and its approval to the sources'.
This assertion rings a certain truth, in that humanists were quite ready to speak out against any kind of practice which they considered a perversion of the true faith.
Consequently, we find that Erasmus freely criticised the incorporation of pagan elements into the Christian faith, and the complicity of the clergy in these practices: 'so it be of ghosts, spirits, goblins, devils, or the like; [...] the further they are from truth, the more readily they are believed and the more do they tickle their itching ears.
And these serve not only to pass away time but bring profit, especially to mass priests and pardoners'.
Furthermore, he criticised the fact that selling indulgences evaded the simple fact that 'to live well is the way to die well'.
While humanist and reformer alike stressed the simple and direct relationship in which the individual stood to God, the period directly preceding the reformation saw the sweeping popularity of so-called sacramentals, small objects that were to have sacred protective powers, turning the religious experience into 'a kind of popular Catholic version of the priesthood of all believers'.
Catholic theologians were quick to assert that the working of sacramentals worked, not through physical efficacy; rather, it was spiritual efficacy, based on the prayers of the church', yet, Luther attacked the very authority of the church as an intermediary between the individual and God.
'How much more properly did the apostles call themselves servants of the present Christ', he wrote in an open letter to pope Leo X, 'and not [like the clergy] vicars of an absent Christ?'.
Such boldness did certainly lie outside the tradition of pre-reformation humanists, who, despite their criticism, were nearly all 'men who saw themselves as operating within the context of the church'.

</fnote>On a note, however, it must be added that much of the question of the relation between humanism and the reformation depends on definition.
Kristeller has rightly pointed out that humanism, taken in a broad definition, 'was not [...] Catholic or Protestant, [...] although it is easy to find [for both of them] a certain number of humanists who favoured them'.
More correctly was it a new scholarly attitude, which often had little directly to do with theological questions.
Naturally, humanist achievements did much to aid reformist criticism of the church, thereby unintentionally damaging the pope's authority as ultimate arbiter of religious matters.
By 1520, Luther felt sufficiently confident to claim that '[t]heir claim that only the pope may interpret scripture is an outrageous facied fable'.
Moreover, while many humanists were entangled in a 'productive misunderstanding' of reformation doctrine, similarly 'the response of reformers and traditionalists to humanism was improvised and lacked any clear, programmatic agenda'.

</fnote>The intellectual life of northern European humanists had brought extensive soil for social development.
Influenced by Italian humanists, many German humanists had studied at Italian universities, while extensive correspondence and printed works guaranteed a considerable reading audience to some of the more famous scholars such as Erasmus.
This intellectual network now came to serve the reformation twofold.
While it came to counter the vices of "popular religion", which reformers and humanists alike attacked, it also created a well-publicised stage for a reformed alternative.
While religious life in reformed thought experienced a kind of rationalisation, relying only on the scriptures (sola scriptura), all acts in daily life were now to the honour of God.
Simultaneously, too, the reformers managed through humanist channels to justify this transformation.
Luther's new doctrine of justification now freed Christians from 'an agreed bargain involving a near-legal sense of obligation', thus evading the need for an authoritarian church.
Aided by forthright humanists such as the patriotic nobleman Ulrich von Hutten, the church was portrayed as 'an unjust, unkind, and bloodthirsty shepherd'.
Thus, the reformation succeeded in countering 'religion in favour of an emotional sensibility too preoccupied with outward appearances', managing to some extent to draw parallels between the opposites religion/magic and Germany/Rome.

</fnote>The spread of these new ideas came hand in hand.
While many humanists, trained and educated in Italy, brought up 'questions that [...] were discussed openly and debated in public', their sojourns in Italy generally brought out 'what was peculiarly Germanic'.
Luther's address to the German nobility, then, must also be seen in this light.
'All classes in Christendom, particularly in Germany [my italics], are now oppressed by distress and affliction', Luther wrote, and it is not unlikely that some of the German nobility supported his reformed Christianity for national-political reasons.
After all, since Luther refuted the idea that any active works or confession were of any importance in an individual's relationship to God, this discredited the authority of the church as a body of absolute mediation.

</fnote>To conclude, the role of humanism in preparing the ground enabling a reformation to take place in Germany and the rest of northern Europe was very great.
Despite the fact that many a humanist was, and remained, supportive of the church in Rome, the humanist challenges to education, thereby firmly establishing the studia humanitatis around Europe, was of tremendous importance for the theological and social atmosphere to bring about further-going criticism of the church institutions.
Moreover, many of the humanist values were shared by the reformation movement.
The emphasis on text-based studies was of key importance to Luther (sola scriptura), while the study of classical Greek and Latin texts enabled Zwingli to successfully challenge the church's position on several matters.
Both humanists and reformers criticised the incorporation of pagan elements such as sacramentals, which they considered charms, and the church's trade of indulgences.
Indeed, Luther's ideas and style of criticism of the church bore such semblance to humanist traditions, that the first period of clash saw the support of many humanists, which has been described as a 'productive misunderstanding', which, additionally, brought much attention to the Wittenberg disputation through the humanists' extensive correspondence network.
<fnote>McGrath, The Intellectual Origins, p. 47.
</fnote>The exact relation between humanists and reformers has been a matter of dispute among scholars of our time.
It depends, firstly, on a definition of humanism.
While humanism knew certain general traits, it was not necessarily confined by a certain theological outlook, and the humanist movement was never united on theological matters.
In fact, the period after the reformation saw the emergence of a number of prominent Protestant humanists.
Thus, we can say humanism and reformation were mutually influencing, the reformer often using humanist tools in his pursuits, while many humanists, often demonstratively Teutonic, admired the reformation movement.
The writing of Simmel on the discipline of sociology is characterised by a desire to reduce the study of society to its essence.
Instead of viewing society as Durkheim did, that is, as a generic force working externally of the individual and reifying itself through organisational structures and artefacts, Simmel was rather concerned with giving a 'serious [...]analysis of the social bond' (Nisbit 1959: 479), which can be described as the reciprocally working relation between two or more social actors.
He denounced the view that a society "as such" could exist outside individuals (Simmel 1971a: 27), preferring to build a sociological system from the individual's standpoint.
In the first place, Simmel represented social interaction as the dynamic attempt to reconcile the opposite drives within each human being - 'for example, the individual and the group, the need for conformity and for individuation, the need for stability and for flexibility' (Abel 1959: 478).
Despite the theoretical character of these opposites, Simmel believed all "forms-of-sociation" are to some extent conditioned by the tension between them.
Secondly, Simmel sought to separate the forms these conflicting ways of behaving could take, and their socio-historically dependent content.
The form thereby attains a certain "objective" quality, acting as a generally discernable trait in a variety of social circumstances.
As an illustration of this position, Simmel considered the phenomenon of secrecy to be a social form which could, therefore, not be judged as such, as it 'stands in neutrality above the value functions of its content' (Simmel 1950: 331).
Furthermore, the greater the number of links through sociation, the more the social sphere becomes "society".
Critics have recognised Simmel's breach with the nineteenth century approach of "doing" sociology: constructing a model of society and then coming up with solutions to its problems.
It has been argued that this way of theorising society created laws and principles 'too vague and too sweeping to be applicable in practical circumstances' (Abel 1959: 475).
Hence, it was exactly 'the microsociological character' of Simmel's approach to sociology which won his writing its original quality over other sociologists (Nisbit 1959: 480).
The extent of strict reductionism in Simmel's writing, however, must not be exaggerated.
Simmel did recognise that, while only forms, forms-of-sociation could take different shapes (contents), with, at times, such strong social repercussions that the social sphere acquired a nearly metaphysical quality.
Consequently, he wrote of keeping a secret that it 'produces an immense enlargement of life: [...] the possibility of a second world alongside the manifest world; and the latter is decisively influenced by the former' (Simmel 1950: 330).
Much of Simmel's writing on approaches to sociological studies is related to the role of abstraction, and its balance in relation to concrete situations.
He stressed the value of a division between a broader, psychological approach to social drives, and the shapes these drives take in interacting with others, whom allow or resist these drives in varying degrees, and simultaneously in their turn attempt to give shape to their personal drives.
Hence, 'the further development of every relation is determined by the ratio of persevering and yielding energies which are contained in the relation' (Simmel 1950: 334).
Because of his view of society as the result of the constant reciprocal interaction and mutual pressure of concretely realised social forms Simmel is widely recognised as primarily 'a sociologist of forms' (Nisbit 1959: 479).
The role of forms-of-sociation, however, was of even greater importance to him.
In Simmel's writings on how sociology ought to approach the social question, he proposed that the detachment of the intention of a social action (form) from the actual deed was the fundamental solution to gain a greater insight in the working of the social sphere.
Indeed, Simmel went even further and proposed that '[t]o separate, by scientific abstraction, these two factors of form and content which are in reality inseparably united; [...] seems to me the basis for the only, as well as the entire, possibility of a special science of society as such' (Simmel 1971a: 25).
To illustrate the position of the sociologist within such a framework of thinking, Simmel drew an analogy between society and language.
While both convey a message, they express this in particular way, embedded in the context of their users.
This particularity, in both cases, is conditioned by economical standing, and historical and cultural forces.
Still, we can trace a binding element between all users across time and social position.
The shape the social takes is conditioned by the intention that the individual may have.
Thus, social forms are like grammar, which 'isolates the forms of languages from their contents' beyond the 'heterogeneity of content and purposes which life reveals' (Nisbit 1959: 480), while the sociologist attempts to atomise and describe this "social grammar".
The separation of form and content automatically assumes the individual as the basis for a social interaction.
It thereby recognises the role of psychology in determining the origins of social behaviour (Simmel 1971a).
Simmel was, however, much concerned with defining the proper territory of sociology, arguing that 'we are not interested in the psychological processes that occur in each of the two individuals but in their subsumption under the categories of union and discord' (Simmel 1971a: 34).
All we can properly and legitimately call society is 'a mode of existence which concretely expresses itself in the reciprocal relations of human beings' (Abel 1959: 475).
The social grid of forms-of-sociation owes to Kant's virtue ethics in that it separates intention from action (Craib 1997: 56); Simmel, however, was not concerned with adding a value judgment but argued that the sociologist should solely attempt to determine the "grammar" of society by example.
A point of criticism in the use of forms as social elements separate from the real may be that it creates an extent of theoretical abstraction.
For Simmel, however, this practice only has a function as a theoretical exercise.
'In any given social phenomenon, content and societal form constitute on reality' (Simmel 1971a: 24), he argued; the separation of form is to serve as a tool for interpretation of case study.
In fact, in this, Simmel went even further than Weber, whom, with his use of the "ideal types" provided the two theoretical ends of a scale on which a particular society can then be placed.
Simmel, on the contrary, insisted that the use of forms must always relate to 'a piece of history, either past or present' (Abel 1959: 479).
As a result, all Simmelian sociological concepts such as 'status, Gemeinschaft, relative deprivation, and solidarity' maintain a degree concreteness despite their traits of universality (Abel 1959: 478).
Due to the position, moreover, that '[f]orm and content cannot, in practice, be separated' (Nisbit 1959: 480), much of Simmel's writing did in fact not maintain such a theoretical strictness.
He recognised this fact, but saw this rather as a natural process of knowledge-gathering, which, in sociology, can only be done in concrete terms: '[t]hrough [...] a study, of course, these forms would lose in applicability what they would gain in definiteness' (Simmel 1971a: 28).
The use of the term "form" must, therefore, not be seen as an equivalent of "social law", since a conception of law may exist independently from the individual, while "form" must always be filled in by "content", like a geometrical shape needs a material to exist at all (Simmel 1971a).
Another point of criticism that has been brought to the fore, is the way in which sociology, in Simmel's conception, occupies a place merely as the study of the microsocial, which comes out of the distinction between and form and content as the only purely human element in social relations (Abel 1959: 476).
It is, furthermore, a point of inconsistency between Simmel's writing on what sociological studies should consist of, and his actual sociological treatises.
For example, when Simmel describes the social form "secrecy" as 'a formal means of boasting and of subordinating the others' (Simmel 1950: 332), this definition is much narrower than his further expansion on its role in associations, and the physical-spatial element that secrecy often involves.
Hence, it can be said that the Simmel's descriptions of the content often go beyond what he himself characterised as the elements that make up a society.
By focussing on the microsocial element of society, Simmel failed to appropriate the external force of society over the individual, arguing, contrarily to Durkheim, that 'with every growth of new synthesising phenomena [...], the same group becomes "more society" than it was before' (Simmel 1971a: 27); that is - society is the sum-total of all microsocial interaction.
Since, as mentioned above, 'the investigation of forms-of-sociation, requested by Simmel, involves the determination of their functions with regard to social life' (Abel 1959: 478), it may be of value to assess Simmel's application of the use of forms in one of his own investigations.
In his essay 'The Metropolis and Mental Life', Simmel draws a parallel with the emergence of conglomerations of people in the metropolis on the one hand, and the coming into existence of new ways of social interaction or the absence of interaction due to a growth of individualism (Simmel 1971b: 325).
In this model, the metropolis may be seen as the expression, or content, of the various forms-of-sociation that we associate with modernity and the emergence of individuality.
Thence, life in the metropolis sees a dual, antagonistic development: on the one hand, the vast increase of daily moments of interaction between people, while on the other hand, individuals 'retreat from excessive external stimuli [which are social content]' (Frisby 1992: 66).
According to Simmel, the foremost conflict in metropolitan society can be observed in the tension between the individual, rationalistic, and the weight of the continuing flux of impressions upon the emotive, subjective side of each person.
This creates two types of extreme social reactions.
On the one hand, '[t]he purely intellectualistic person [who] is indifferent to all things personal' (Simmel 1971b: 326) becomes wholly disinterested and impatient in interaction with others.
For him, or her, '[t]he meaning and value of the distinction between things, and therewith of the things themselves, are experienced as meaningless' (Simmel 1971b: 330), solely out of a vast overflow of impressions in everyday life.
On the other hand, maintaining a superficial, rational approach toward others may result in nervous breakdowns and agoraphobia, which Simmel regarded as 'pathological characteristics of modern cities' (Vidler 1991: 36).
This view, despite providing an interesting model for the social effects of modern life, however shows some ambiguities in definition and theoretical inconsistency, while it steps over a few essential elements without touching upon them.
For, when Simmel remarks that 'the metropolis [...] has outgrown every personal element' (Vidler 1991: 38), he does not satisfactorily substantiate this view in the terms that he set out as sociological tools.
It remains unclear, for example whether the metropolis sees an "increase" or "decrease" of the "thing" society.
For, while numbers of contact moments, which are essentially opportunities to add content to form vastly increase, they simultaneously become infinitely more fragmented, single-minded and disinterested.
To add to this problem of definition, it can be argued that each individual 'derives [these] values and improvements from this collective' (Wolff 1950: 54).
Here we arrive at the fundamental complexity of form as a strictly separate theoretical concept.
From Simmel, we may read that the form of 'the secret is a first-rate element of individualization' (Simmel 1950: 334), while principally it is a social form which, despite the fact that it must, per definition, involve more than one social actor, on the other hand consist of not sharing something with others.
This makes the distinction between the individual and the social a very troubled one, from which one can conclude that 'a person is never merely a collective being just as he is never merely an individual being' (Levine 1971: 261).
As '[t]he social is determined, but it is also determining' (Abel 1959: 476), it is necessary to provide a strong definition of the forms-of-sociation before anything can be said of its relation to forms.
While people engage in relationships with each other 'to satisfy their mutual and individual needs' (Craib 1997: 56), this does, however, not provide us with a very firm tool to determine the every-day content of such forms: we might think of the relationship between two individuals and something as abstract and indirect as the state.
Moreover, by leaving out physical aspects of a model of society, Simmel narrows the understanding that sociology may generate of society.
Thus, while Simmel acknowledges that '[s]ome social forms, such as the state, manifest themselves in a unique and localized space that excludes the possibility of forms inhabiting the same space' (Vidler 1991: 39), he fails to appropriate this fact in a societal sense.
Yet, when a person gets a prison sentence, this is not the direct result of his interaction with merely the judge, but rather does this spring from a relation within a more collective set of concepts such as "the law" and "the state".
Interpreting this example in purely microsocial, individual relations means missing the impersonal and continuous aspects of social organisation.
In conclusion, the separation between form and content is important in that it stresses 'the "humanistic coefficient"' (Abel 1959: 479) in social relations.
Whereas it allows a certain degree of generalisation of human drives within a heterogeneity of social circumstances, Simmel's theory stresses that we should not lose the 'element of irriducible humanism' (Nisbit 1959: 481) in society.
It also stresses the direct reciprocal influence of individuals over each other in every-day social relations: '[t]he significance of [...] interactions among men lies in the fact that it is because of them that the individuals, in whom these driving impulses and purposes are lodged, form a unity, that is, a society.'
(Simmel 1971a: 23).
Thus, Simmel's reductionist sociology reveals a certain immediacy and existentialism to it.
This approach to sociology, however, brings up a number of problems which Simmel sought to address by simply placing all socio-historical biases and influences inside the person-to-person relationships which gave content to universal, timeless forms.
This brings about an antagonism in Simmel's system of thought, in that it reveals a disparity between the apparent behaviour (or action) of an individual's reaction to another, while this particular social form can only be analysed in a wider, macrosocial context.
Especially more continuous, bigger forms of organisation have a greater sense of impersonality to them, making the underlying form (essentially a drive springing from individual actors) hard to define and ambiguous.
The separation of form and content is thus a very useful too in the study of microsocial relations, but cannot be seen to contend any notion of a "society in its entirety".
The emergence of the sociological school of ethnomethodology in the early 1960s created a shock wave across the sociological establishment.
Its revision of social norms and their relation to the social action springing from individual cases of social interaction was indeed deemed so radical that stories exist of 'ethnomethodologists being fired from their jobs simply because they were ethnomethodologists' (Craib 1992: 102).
However, what may at first glance appear a drastically individualistic approach to social relations theory must be seen as embedded within a wider philosophical and social scientific critique of the value of conventional types of knowledge (Alexander 1987).
Ethnomethodology asserts that functionalist theory lays an exaggerated amount of emphasis on collectivity within social relations, crystallised in organisations and norms of interaction that are derived therefrom.
By first theorising a consistent system of norms, subsequent data gathered from social observation are then "made to fit" within this system.
These data are, as traditional sociology has it, 'as it were, readily waiting' (Silverman 1972: 173) to be categorised.
This, however, naturally creates a tension, as 'the meaning employed by those we study - their norms, values, attitudes and beliefs; the rules which govern their conduct - are treated as if their meaning were unproblematic' (Craib 1992: 103).
This can even be observed to be the case in highly advanced social theories, as the overarching theoretical grid still requires the classification of a highly contestable and unstable social reality "out there": 'To employ such 'operational' or 'theory-laden' categories is not to escape the ascriptive or imputative work that ordinary action-concept usages carry with them' (Coulter 1979: 11).
By failing to observe the complication characteristic of such norm-attribution, sociologists fall into the trap of taking sets of typification for granted, thereby tacitly avoiding the 'problem of concealed, commonsense commitments' (Coulter 1979: 15) to which all social actors involved conform.
Instead, according to ethnomethodologists, the only way to avoid adding to such a body of affirmative "folk sociology" is to 'seek to understand the process of experiencing' (Silverman 1972: 166), by searching for the underlying motivation of action of each social actor.
Such a methodology abstains from explaining social phenomena in immediate relation to abstract, theoretical norms, deriving actual interaction from alternative, everyday commonsensical approaches to social interaction, which have also been described as "second-order typifications", 'typifications of our common-sense typifications which order the social world in a rational way' (Craib 1992: 99-100).
Instead of taking methods of social ordering for granted, the sociologist may then concern himself or herself with 'the manner in which members use rules to do the work of defining and interpreting actions' (Silverman 1972: 179).
In this essay I shall discuss the D. Lawrence Wieder's case study of "the code", a semi-formal normative body maintained as the set of social rules by which residents in a 'rehabilitative facility for narcotic-addict felons on parole' (Wieder 1974: 144) claim to measure the validity of their social action.
This ethnomethodological ethnographic study may provide interesting insights into how, for all actors involved in any organisational structure, 'talk and action are produced and understood as indexical displays of the everyday world' (Cicourel 1973: 99).
The problematic relation Wieder discovers between the norms as he has them explained to him, and as he sees those norms put in practice reveals the usefulness for, 'not a commonsense sociology but a sociology of commonsense' (Silverman 1972: 170), an often arbitrary and precarious battlefield for social power negotiation.
I shall thereafter also look at the limitations of such an approach to sociological studies.
In his analysis of the role of "telling the code", Wieder begins by looking more closely at the way in which he personally internalised its meaning.
As he received information on the content of "the code" piecemeal, it became necessary to create an internal schema for understanding it.
In this way, it became possible to interpret further bits of information, while simultaneously elaborating the internal system into a generic and constantly expanding body of understanding.
'Each newly encountered 'piece' of talk was simultaneously rendered sensible by interpreting it in terms of the developing relevancies of the code and was, at the same time, more evidence of the existence of that code' (Wieder 1974: 161).
Hereby, Wieder points out the indexical functioning of the "code system": the various norms at the core serve to interpret behaviour which is said to be based on it.
However, this "indexing" of behaviour was not quite an unproblematic or effortless method.
Behavioural significance was rendered only 'meaningful in the ways that it was said socially-in-a-context' (Wieder 1974: 163).
While Wieder initially observed that he related residents' uncooperative attitudes quite naturally to the norms described in the convict code, he found that such categorisation could at times be rather arbitrary, resulting in situations in which <quote> '...either chosen alternative would be equally plausible interpretations in terms of the same rule, even though the alternatives propose opposite actions.
[...] Instead of 'predicting' behavior, the rule is actually employed as an interpretative device' (Wieder 1974: 168).</quote>According to Wieder, all of residents' behaviour was, in the end, placed, and thereafter rendered rational, in the light of the convict code.
It created, for the observer, a method in which social '...order and orderliness is accomplished - that is, it involves interpretive "work"' (Silverman 1972: 175).
In the light of such formalistic social meta-theories as Durkheim's, the position of residents is understandable in terms of the social force of the convict code weighing upon them as an "institutionalised" norms of interaction.
This position, however, fails to see the manipulative, indefinite character of the convict code, using instead 'the fact of norm compliance to assume that [the residents'] action has a compliant character, that it is passive and conformistic rather than active and constructing' (Alexander 1987: 274).
In opposition to this, ethnomethodology, rather taking an individualistic stance, argues that in the enactment of norms (in this case described as "telling the code"), 'there is negotiation vis-à-vis [the meaning of these] rules'.
In a similar vein, Cicourel has argued that 'this [...] environment of objects cannot be tied easily to notions like status, role and norms, employed by actors in less structured or controlled everyday situations' (Cicourel 1973: 15).
In other words, norms only derive meaning from their enactment, which is continually negotiated and whose stability depends on the degree of acceptance which the various social actors concede to the meaning contained within the enactment.
Under normal circumstances, the process of norm negotiation takes place without great complication, as 'we are frequently engaged in making connections in our descriptions' (Coulter 1979: 15).
In this process of "making sense" of the social stimuli around us, we draw upon previous experience, thus arriving at 'a series of commonsense constructs [which we] have pre-selected and pre-interpreted [from] this world which [we] experience as the reality of their daily lives' (Schutz in Coulter 1979: 9).
Beyond this, the analogy of "making sense" extends further in the sense of serving the purpose of creating structural coherence and predictability in our perception of the world that we experience.
A convincing set of behavioural rules such as the convict code is necessary to order the residents' forms of social interaction, which is, in fact, 'knowledge [that] is itself inherently unstable, something which is created anew in each encounter' (Craib 1992: 102).
The precariousness of resident-staff interaction is pointed out by its strong dependence on contextuality.
With "the code" in mind as an interpretative tool, all actors involved (which in this case may involve the residents, members of staff and the observer), continually scan incoming social stimuli for recognisable modes of behaviour which may contextually seem logical.
In doing this, variables as the particular social actors, the setting and the timing play an indispensable role for practices of indexing, i.e., "sense-making" (Cicourel 1973: 101, Wieder 1974).
In this context, staff's reaction to residents' 'problematic acts' were not confronted as subversive behaviour; rather was their character now converted 'into instances of a familiar pattern' (Wieder 1974: 151).
In this way, the facility's staff utilised the convicts' code in order 'to formulate a recognizable coherent story, standard, typical, cogent, uniform, planful, i.e., a professionally defensible, and thereby, for members, a recognizably rational account' (Garfinkel in Alexander 1987: 262-3).
Unsurprisingly, Wieder sees "telling the code" in the first place as a means of justification of the chosen course of action.
By "telling the code", residents explain and justify why they will not cooperate in certain situations or answer certain questions posed by staff.
By accepting the code, staff, in turn, account for residents' uncooperativeness in activities and rehabilitative procedures.
<quote>''Telling the code' provided staff with a useful way of talking about residents and themselves which portrayed both teams as more or less reasonable and more or less helpless to change the character of the relationship between the teams, because of the social-fact character (in Durkheim's sense) of the regularities made available by 'telling the code' which were none of anybody's specific doing or responsibility' (Wieder 1974: 151)</quote>Interesting is Wieder's reference to Durkheim: in "telling the code", all social actors in the facility render types of social interaction institutionalised, thereby attempting to (though not actually) reifying them (Durkheim's "social facts").
With this, however, the door is only just opened to further and more penetrating interpretations of action-motivation.
Ethnomethodology points out that, in order to gain real understanding that means something, 'intentions and the actor's views are always potentially relevant and must be taken into account' (Pitkin in Coulter 1979: 12-3).
Indeed, by assuming interpretation ends at normative causality, sociologists inevitably miss out on the politics underlying social action (Coulter 1979: 11, Silverman 1972: 175).
The darker, more precarious side of social interaction lies in the tensions of power underneath its surface.
Ethnomethodology does not deny the existence of a "common culture", and this would be an absurd claim to make (Alexander 1987: 262); however, the precariousness of social interaction is exactly that what this "common culture" is not: individuals may challenge the existing order by either directly confronting it, or, more subtly, by manipulating its general traits to their advantage.
Whether this challenge is pursued consciously or not is, strictly spoken, not relevant; as Pitkin asserts, 'One may have to intend to lie in order to lie, but one need not intend to deceive in order to deceive' (Pitkin in Coulter 1979: 12).
An analogy may here be found in the functioning of penal codes, in that 'the fit is 'managed' through negotiating socially organized activities' (Cicourel 1973: 13) in which both hidden and open methods of manipulation are used.
The position Wieder takes in his account of the role of the convict code draws on the traditions of both radically challenging all knowledge in a systematic way, and emphasising the inescapable burdens of responsibility that social action brings with it.
It is therefore no surprise that 'phenomenological sociology, existential sociology, [and] the sociology of everyday life' (Craib 1992: 97) are often mentioned in conjunction with one another.
The indefiniteness of society described by such a sociology stresses a few characteristics.
In the first place, we can observe that social "roles" have a dynamic character that extends beyond the immediately observable social surface.
It can be observed that 'the dynamic aspect of status or office and such is always influenced by factors other than the stipulations of the position itself' (David in Cicourel 1973: 14).
From this follows, secondly, that the situational placement of social interaction takes an important place in determining its meaning, i.e.
it is not just about what actors speak, but more importantly about how communication takes place (Garfinkel in Alexander 1987: 270).
Thirdly, the constant change in interpretation of social norms results in an extreme degree of relativism invoked by ethnomethodology (Craib 1992: 102).
In assuming the '"adequate" or "appropriate" operational definitions' (Silverman 1972: 177), staff of the "halfway house" avoided facing up to the existential question of where this appropriateness was derived from.
Thus, Wieder can ultimately only conclude one thing: ''Telling the code' masked what was 'really going on' at the halfway house - what was 'really going on' was residents' pursuing their immediate interests by fabricating instances of 'telling the code' which deceived me and the staff' (Wieder 1974: 169).
Naturally, Wieder's approach is not free from criticism.
It can, in the first place, be said that it gives a rather cynical, or at least extremely sceptical account the natural course that social interaction takes within the example of his case study.
While underlying forces may be at work in social interaction, it is entirely possible that even the social actors involved are not aware of them.
Residents in the facility may, in fact, feel that behaviour represents a genuine reflection of the loyalty and distrust that the convict code at varying times demands of him.
Likewise, it is not unrealistic to think that staff generally recognises the "realness" of the code and in instances acts in accordance with it to protect certain individual residents.
In other words, the convict code is not entirely without justified grounded.
This problem brings under discussion the extent to which the freedom to negotiate socials norms actually exists.
Regarded as a whole, society can be said to be rather more stable than the Wieder claims from within the ethnomethodological perspective.
Thus, while Wieder's approach may be laudably seen to attempt to incorporate 'a genuine humanism in an ideological sense', it can be asked '[w]hether this moral humanism is theoretically justified' (Alexander 1987: 280).
In his account of how the convict code is to be interpreted, Wieder emphasises how it obtains a indexical status.
Rather like the coding system of books in a library, its norms serve to interpret rather than to describe it.
Thus, norms serve as a tacit justification of real events, for both social actors and the sociologist.
A truer account of events, is, however, more complicated.
By accepting norms as motivation and authentic drives of social actors, the convict code came to serve as a tool of rendering behaviour logical and coherent.
For staff, this tool justified an acceptance of nonconformist behaviour from the residents' side, while the residents often successfully manipulated it to their direct advantage.
This underlying differentiation reveals the political and arbitrary nature of social norms, however developed and "theory-laden".
In his approach to sociology, Wieder, and the wider school of ethnomethodologists, build upon the work of phenomenology and existentialism to show the inescapability of situational variables in the everyday context of social interaction.
Thus, the "what" of social norms must separated from the "how" of interpretation, and subsequently analysed at a different level.
This approach, however, has not remained uncriticised.
Many sociologists deem the extent of manipulative power that ethnomethodologists award the individual with unrealistic.
According to them, behaviour is more context-bound and can be seen to be derived from this context.
In that case, Wieder's account of the convict code serves, foremostly, as an existential reminder of the forces underlying our everyday commonsense social interaction. .
The first meeting of Marx and Engels in Paris in 1844 marked the starting point of a legendary friendship and cooperation of two thinkers who left an enormous mark on political development in the twentieth century and whose influence, in the words of a critic, can only be compared to that of Jesus or Mohammed.

</fnote>Marx and Engels lived at a time in which rapid industrialisation brought about exceeding disparities between the property-owning class (the bourgeoisie) and the working class (the proletariat).
Believing capitalism to be only another step toward a society without class antagonisms, Marx turned to studying history and economics, while Engels in 1845 published The Condition of the Working Class in England.
In this work, Engels drew from direct experience and a wide range of sources, arguing that the working class was becoming increasingly conscious of its place and relation to the bourgeoisie, which would in the end inevitably lead to a proletarian revolution.
Marx and Engels were deeply impressed when, in 1844, factory workers revolted in Silesia and Bohemia.
They observed unrest all over Europe, and thus became convinced of the revolutionary potential of the proletariat; a potential which would eventually carry humanity into the next stage of socialism.

</fnote>From circumstance and experience, Marx and Engels were not so much concerned with democracy, but rather with the greater concept of freedom and creating a freer society, in which, they argued, the state would cease to be necessary.
Parliamentary democracy, in the eyes of Marx and Engel, was nothing more than the crystallisation of the contradictory interests between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, and could not be different.
Moreover, by separating the government from civil society, 'the bourgeois state and its attendant ideas of political rights and common national interests functioned, like religion, as an opium, an illusory compensation and thus a support for the injustices of civil society'.
A radical change was needed for the advance at first of the proletariat and eventually of society as a whole.

Marx's drive to act upon theory soon brought him into international communist circles.
After heated debate at a congress in London in 1847, Marx and Engels were commissioned to write a political programme for the Communist League.
Its result, the Communist Manifesto, can be regarded as Marx's and Engels' most outspoken vision on class struggle and the predestined faith of the proletariat.
'The proletariat', the Communist Manifesto stated confidently, 'goes through various stages of development'.
Then, the manifesto goes on to speak in deterministic terms that the proletarian 'mission is to destroy all previous securities for, and insurances of, individual property'.

</fnote>If this scenario were to be the inevitable course of events, the logical question would be: why?
Analysing history, Marx and Engels had discovered a continuous struggle for power between a powerful minority and a weak majority.
They noted that 'All previous historical movements were movements of minorities, or in the interest of minorities'.
However, it seemed that the proletariat would be able to break through this tendency.
'The proletarian movement is the self-conscious, independent movement of the immense majority, in the interest of the immense majority'.
In this sense, it can be argued that for Marx and Engels, a primitive idea of democratic, or majority, rights served to justify a complex social theory of inevitable revolutionary struggle.
Convinced about the power and improvement value of the theory of class struggle, 'His [Engels'] and Marx's historical vision was optimistic about the future, tragic when it turned to the past, as a record so dreadfully bad that any sacrifice was worth while to get away from it'.

</fnote>When Lenin became leader of the Bolsheviks in the early twentieth century, a debate among Marxists had been around for nearly fifteen years concerning the best way to bring about communism.
One section of the Second International of 1889, under the leadership of Bernstein, had come to embrace the idea of social democracy, and of participation in parliamentary politics.
Where Marx had been careful in his wording, or more abstract in his discussion of the democracy question, Lenin was more articulate in his discussion of the matter.
He briefly defined the state as 'a special organization of force: it is an organization of violence for the suppression of some class'.
Therefore, he argued, a revolution was the necessary agent for the transition from capitalism to socialism.

In this article he advocated a 'revolutionary democratic dictatorship of the proletariat and peasantry', a term that Marx had used only once, in a letter to a friend.
What contrasted the Bolsheviks from the anarchists, Lenin argued, was that Bolsheviks thought it necessary to establish a transitory government to place the proletariat firm in the seat of power.
However, months before the October revolution, in April 1917, he wrote that this would be 'a state without a standing army, without a police opposed to the people, without an officialdom placed above the people', based on Marx's example of his view of the Paris Commune.
Eventually, in Engels' words, the government would slowly 'wither away' because it would become unnecessary.

</fnote>By 1917, Lenin observed that the key conditions were fulfilled in Russia for a proletarian revolution to take place.
An imperialist war was raging over Europe, according to Marxist theory calling in the culmination of capitalism.
Conditions in Russia, he argued, were peculiar, as the country had already seen a revolution in February 1917.
'We have existing side by side, together, simultaneously, both the rule of the bourgeoisie [...] and a revolutionary-democratic dictatorship of the proletariat and the peasantry, which is voluntarily ceding power to the bourgeoisie, voluntarily transforming itself into an appendage of the bourgeoisie'.
According to Lenin, the masses had 'been confused, led astray and deceived' by the temporary government of Lvov and Kerensky.
He adopted Trotsky's idea of 'permanent revolution', arguing that the proletariat could not stop after overthrowing the bourgeois government.
By not completing the dictatorship of the proletariat, the government itself had gone over to the side of the bourgeoisie.

</fnote>In practice, much of Lenin's writing at the dawn of the October revolution appears to excuse the Bolsheviks' grasp for power and subsequent policy.
Eventually, Bolshevik rule directly after the revolution proved to be highly undemocratic.
In 1918, all political parties that did not support the Bolsheviks were systematically suppressed; while a temporary oligarchic, highly centralised government was formed, taking in members by co-option rather than by democratic elections.
Rosa Luxemburg was among the prominent critics of Lenin's post-revolution, oppressive policy.
'The negative, the tearing down, can be decreed; the building up, the positive cannot', she argued.
According to her, Lenin was standing in the way of a democratic learning process of the proletariat.
'The broadest democracy was needed', otherwise 'socialism will be decreed from behind a few official desks by a dozen intellectuals'.
Although Lenin argued that such policy was needed in 'defence against counterrevolution and the actual elimination of everything that contradicted the sovereignty of the people', this, according to Luxemburg, was 'not the dictatorship of the proletariat, [...] but only the dictatorship of a handful of politicians'.

Despite its rhetoric, the Soviet Union of Stalin appeared to many something other than socialism.
Theory was increasingly not matching policy.
The state did not wither away, instead, a status quo of power was developing; one in which all lines came together in Moscow.
An elite of scientifically based professional revolutionaries would 'show the way, formulating the program and policies, educating the people, and working out the strategy and tactics'.
The character of the government had changed since the October revolution.
Stalin's biographer, Deutscher, wrote: 'It has assumed office as a government of the people, by the people and for the people [...][now,] it ceases to be government by the people'.
Indeed, it is arguable that the rapid industrialisation and agricultural reforms represented some elevated aspiration of the proletariat and peasants, however, the price of these reforms (The 1936 Great Terror and show trials) was disproportionate and tragic.
Moreover, they revealed a highly undemocratic and unrepresentative government that stood separate from the masses.

</fnote>The approximately hundred-year period over which the intellectual and political activity of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin spread has seen the emergence of an immense social and political experiment of revolution and the move toward a communist state.
The concept of democracy has over this time been much debated and scrutinised in order to deprive it of its 'bourgeois' elements.
However, in the theories of Marx and Engels, there has been too little space left open for a pluralistic approach to state organisation.
Likewise, Lenin and Stalin never achieved the 'withering away of the state' into a 'revolutionary-democratic dictatorship of the proletariat' upon the gap that fell after the October revolution of 1917.
Communism, or some pure form of democracy within society's organisation has never been achieved.

</fnote>Rousseau has always been typified as an intellectual outsider; it was, however, only in the twentieth century that his socio-political theory came to be seen as a threat to the individual's liberty.
Emphasis thereby is often laid on his concept of a 'general will', through which personal liberty is handed over to the collective.
'The citizens having but one interest', Rousseau argues, 'the people [have] but a single will'.
And although Rousseau favours the ballot vote, he argues for the infallibility of its ruling: 'when the opinion contrary to my own prevails, it proves nothing more than that I made a mistake, and that what I took to be the general will was not'.
From the point of view of Rousseau, most importantly protection should be rendered against the emergence of a minority rule, or 'particular will', rather than against the state, which, after all, represents the sovereignty of the lawgiver as it corresponds with the community's best interest, the general will.
The question I will look at here is thus to what extent the critical assertion holds truth that 'the more safeguards he established against despotism, the more weapons he forged for tyranny', within Rousseau's system of the social contract.

</fnote>Recent criticism has argued that the Cold War split has caused intellectuals to make an over-simplified distinction between 'individualistic liberalism and state collectivism', stating that Rousseau was on the totalitarian side of the argument.
Rousseau, however, from the outset entertains an awareness of the problem of new forms of subjugation that hide behind a powerful state, and thus sets out to construct a model for a 'form of association [...] in which each, while uniting himself with all, may still obey himself alone, and remain free as before'.
In this sense, Rousseau undertakes to find a form in which freedom can be exercised on a public, political level.
The important distinction that has to be made here though, is the type of freedom at stake.
Arguing that pre-modern, pre-social man exercised an individual sovereignty free from social obligation or commitment, knew a natural, brutal kind of liberty.
When people come to regular interaction, they become interdependent, which goes accompanied by fierce passions.
It is only within society that morality comes to exist, through virtue and pitié, a form of compassion which counters man's corruption by society.
What is then needed is the construction of an association in which passions are tempered and virtue is encouraged.
In this sense, envisaging a social contract is merely a theoretical exercise, to find a form in which such an exercise of sovereignty can be best expressed, in other words, 'Rousseau's purpose is to discover a rule which has moral validity'.

</fnote>Another point of view insists on the juxtaposition of democracy and liberalism, positioning Rousseau in a radically democratic framework.
Certainly, this view depends greatly on the view one takes of liberalism.
Liberalism can be taken at an individual level, stressing the removal of any constraint on human action (negative liberty), and placing theory in wider context, that of the body politic (positive liberty).
Rousseau is quite explicit about what form of liberty we are to seek.
'Man is born free; and everywhere he is in chains', he argues, 'One thinks himself the master of others, and still remains a greater slave than they'.
It is therefore clear that Rousseau seeks a wider answer to the question of liberty, one for which 'it is necessary to ensure that the conditions in which [people] live do not pose a threat to their survival'.
This condition can be brought about by the realisation that it is the best interest of all citizens to care for other's interest and well-being.
Here we find the distinction that Rousseau makes between a narrow form of personal interest and a wider, more coherent form of enlightened interest, being the best for the community, and thus, indirectly, each citizen's actual will, as it secures the best-considered proposal and enjoys general support of the citizenry.
Subordination to the law subsequently only becomes an exercise of one's liberty.

</fnote>Exercising one's freedom through abiding by the law is only reasonable if lawgiver and subject are the same person.
This is where Rousseau takes a radically democratic stance, criticising Kant's very open assertion that law can still be legitimate only by the requirement that the requirement 'that the proposal could have been agreed to had the citizens been consulted and were they fully rational'.
Hence Rousseau's claim that 'power indeed may be transmitted, but not the will': for the general will to function, it requires the individual standpoints of each citizen.
Unanimity is thereby not needed; it is in fact a sign of an unhealthy body politic.
The only law that requires unanimity of all citizens is the social pact, since by this each individual hands over their individual sovereignty to the higher expression of the community.
Within the body politic, the general will aims to protect rather than to attack its participants, and 'it is not', therefore, 'to be assumed that any of the parties then expects to get hanged'.
Likewise, peace with neighbouring communities is required by natural law.
It has therefore been claimed that the general will represents a model for the well-being of all, and thus reflects 'each individual's good or real will'.

</fnote>The emphasis that Rousseau lays on the collective, however, is today regarded with mistrust.
After all, the functioning of the general will depends entirely upon the full dedication of the citizenry to the social contract, and we find 'no restriction of principle on what it may command in that form'.
It appears at times as though Rousseau puts all individual risks at right for an ideologically unified community.
As soon as all sovereignty passes from the individual to the state, a greater power comes to exist which '[man] cannot use without the help of others'.
Contrarily, there is no 'safeguards for the individual against the state'.
The Rousseauean state results in collective socialisation, only rendered legitimate through the consent of its participants.
In a wider interpretation of the social contract as merely a thought experiment, this socialisation obtains a somewhat enforced character.

</fnote>One form of criticism of the general will draws parallels with the Jacobin rule during the French revolution.
Both reveal traces of absolutist totalitarianism: 'It is absolutely necessary that evil come from others and from them alone'.
Despite the validity of a critique of Rousseau's reassertion that the general will is infallible (which indeed shows traces of a majority intolerance), it is difficult if not altogether impossible to find examples of the Rousseauean state in practice.
Eastern block socialism, which has been suggested as imposing some for of a state-directed will upon its citizens, has been severely criticised.
Also the Jacobin adoption of Rousseau's general will has been seen as of symbolic value rather than a precise influence of his thought.
Lacking everywhere has been the binding together of lawgiver and subject, which according to Rousseau results only in the imposition a particular will of a state governed by a political elite.

</fnote>It is true that Rousseau is most concerned with the organisation of social order based upon the exercise of virtue, rather than on preserving the individual's relative freedom of action.
It is therefore perhaps surprising that Rousseau leans entirely on the exercise of a general will in ensuring the best for all citizens.
Through this construct, Rousseau categorically denies the individual any sovereignty except for a participatory role in the community.
Effectively, the state attains a strongly fortified position in which ' [t]he more the natural strengths are dead and destroyed, the more the acquired ones are great and durable, and the more solid and perfect this institution is'.
Such a radical step toward an active, creative form of liberalism challenges liberals into the debate of the equalisation of the citizenry, since 'serious economic inequalities destroy liberty'.
Nonetheless, it does not suffice to, as a consequence of this conclusion, leave all individual property and grounds for action within the confines of the community's sovereignty.

</fnote>One of Rousseau's ideas of human nature was that the strongest of human passions was amour the soi (love of self), of which virtue and piti éwere manifestations within society.
'No-one has any interest in making them [the conditions of association] burdensome to others' This may be seen as a problem for the protection of the individual's rights: Rousseau does not expect the intrusion of state into the individual's life and thus includes no precautions to safeguard certain domains of private life.
'If this leads to intervention in 'areas which are perceived as illiberal, such as the social and economic conditions of citizen's lives and with their beliefs and values', this is seen by Rousseau as a decision of the general will in order to secure the necessary conditions for socio-political liberty.
To some extent the modern welfare state can be seen as a moderate outcome of Rousseau's general will, be it on a representative basis.
Executive and lawmaking government of the welfare state is now generally expected to create policy that benefits the community in a broad social sense.
Taxation, health security and economic intervention are put in place to equalise conditions and ensure a minimum standard of welfare for each citizen, whereas participation in elections for government positions is open to each citizen.
This form of moderate liberal welfare state, however, fails to pass the test, since in this model the law does not come from all.

</fnote><fnote>Bertram, Rousseau and The Social Contract, p. 157.
</fnote>The dichotomy between modern, individualist liberalism and the Rousseauean state lies predominantly in their different interpretations of liberty.
Whereas the former stress the lack of protection for the individual in Rousseau's social contract, Rousseau in turn entertains concerns with the crude, unsocial kind of liberty that individualists profess.
Rather does he see liberty in a community best exercised at the highest level, thus enhancing liberty in an ordered way.
For order to exist, there needs to be unity based on a reasonable principle; the social contract offers just that.
As liberty exercised only on the most individual, narrow level only furthers contradiction in interests, Rousseau proposes the pursuit of community interest, which, if carried out fully, secures the welfare and safety of all its citizens.
What Rousseau does not display enough attention to, however, was the fact that 'there is never a perfect fit between moral requirements of our rational nature and requirements of citizenship'.
This results in a lack of consideration of the nature of the general will, and its proper domain.
Rousseau, on the contrary, believes in the stabilising role of the general will, and the inalienability of the will in general.
As the general will represent the only genuine method of determining the sovereign will of the citizenry, parallels drawn between totalitarian ideological states and Rousseau's general will are, strictly theoretical, incorrect.
The problem, nonetheless, lies with the radical solution Rousseau's general will poses.
Asserting that '[t]o be governed by appetite alone is slavery, while obedience to a law one prescribes to oneself is freedom', leaves very little space for individual action.
Thus, a community taking its legislative task to the extreme, might indeed force its citizens into abide by the law.
The question becomes, then, not to what extent Rousseau can be used for totalitarian ends, which he explicitly sets out to prevent, but rather how a feasible system may be envisaged in which particular interpretations of the general good can obtain a stable construct in which the individual is both more protected and better positioned to criticise the state's pursuit of the general good.

</fnote><heading>Introduction</heading>When we talk about the 1930s in terms of social history, we often refer to the strong emergence of ideology into the public domain.
Moreover, for Latin American countries, the first half of the twentieth century marked the coming of 'modernity'.
Other factors, however, such as immigration and a rumbling social hierarchy in the aftermath of slavery, tended to influence society in more informal ways.
Self-representation through culture was usually closest at hand for the lower classes, and often provided a colourful means of communicating a multi-faceted message.
In this essay we shall look at such cultural representations in Argentina, Brazil and Mexico, and assess the extent to which they contributed to the construction of a national identity.
Naturally, art forms such as dance and music were, even though powerful, not the only way of expressing one's national sentiments.
The first films with sound managed to reach a mass audience and demonstrated what it was like to be a true Argentine, or Brazilian, in a light package.
Moreover, the aftermath of key political events (Argentina, the 'infamous decade' after the fall of Yrigoyen; Brazil, the 1930 coup of Vargas; Mexico, the heritage of the revolution) and the subsequent split among the people brought a new literature of thinkers focussing with urgency upon 'national character and the metaphysics of the Mexican, Argentinian or Brazilian 'being''.
The assessment of each country's culture climate thus provides interesting insights into the attempts made at a culturally constructed nationhood.

This did not leave the notion of nationalism untouched; and, after the social positivism of the Irigoyen government that was overthrown in 1930, cultural representations of the Argentine nation became increasingly ambiguous.
The 'Década Infame' brought a reconsideration of Argentine patriotism and the essence of 'Argentineness'.
A new definition of the Argentine identity proved, however, not quite unproblematic.
A nation of immigrants, Argentina had many faces and was, with the coming of further modernity and political maturing of the masses, thrust into a further set of cultural disparities.
These were based upon dichotomies as varied as those of machismo versus feminism, the European-orientated metropolitan versus the patriotic gaucho, and that of the definition of a high culture versus that of commercially formed mass culture.
Essentially, thus, the concept of argentinidad was politically and culturally utilised in a multitude of ideological representations: 'The references to a collective ideal of the argentinidad were continuous [...], although this ideal was defined in the most imprecise way and was basically the product of the whims and wishful thinking of the ideologues who wrote on the subject, more than an ideal that could be identified empirically as a trait of Argentina's culture'.
<fnote>Carlos Escudé, 'The Case of Argentina',  URL , (2000), viewed 2 May 2005.
</fnote>An early elaboration upon Argentine culture and its forms can be found in Sarmiento's Facundo of 1845.
Sarmiento, Argentina's president between 1868 and 1874, regarded the countryside, inhabited by the mestizo gaucho Argentine, as uncivilized, chaotic - even barbarous: 'dirty children covered in rags, living amid packs of dogs; men stretched out on the ground, in utter inactivity; filth and poverty everywhere'.
The country's biggest cities, on the contrary, contained every aspect 'that characterizes cultured people'.
Later, the popular poem about Martín Fierro created a distinction between the good, heroic and patriotic gaucho, and the barbarous and violent bad gaucho.
The early twentieth century thereafter saw a complete rehabilitation of the gaucho icon, when it was presented as an example of argentinidad in an increasingly immigrant-dominated society.
This was, however, merely a constructed and idealised identity, and the by the end of the twenties, the plurality of immigrant cultures were gaining space from more traditional social and cultural dance clubs with names like 'The Patriotic Gauchos'.
In its stead came a new form of dance, less courteous and more fitting in the context of the big metropolis Buenos Aires: tango.

</fnote>The thirties in Argentina were marked by modernising development from above and from below.
The tango started its ascending popularity from below.
A dance of immigrants, it was originally popular in the packed, miserable and crime-ridden suburbs of Buenos Aires.
Its association with knife-fighting and gangs was famously put into words in Borges' short story 'Streetcorner Man' of 1933.
In it, two gang leaders head into confrontation on an illegal tango party.

For a minute of so [the Butcher] was bewildered.
Then, wrapping his arms around La Lujanera, he called to the musicians to play loud and strong, and he ordered the rest of us to dance.
</quote><fnote>Jorge Luis Borges, The Aleph and Other Stories, (London, 1973), p. 27.
</fnote>These aspects - machismo, violence, illegitimacy, made dancing the tango into a rebellious act, associated with characters on the edge of society, devoid of patriotic virtue or morality.
This was soon to change, as the tango was brought to Europe and became popular in the salons of avant-garde Paris.
Before this shift, the tango only gained marginal recognition as a truly Argentine metropolitan dance, as in the poem 'Milonga' by Oliverio Girondo.

</fnote><picture/>A second exponent of tango, nevertheless, soon found through tango a new formula for political criticism, woven into poetical lyrics.
The song 'Cambalache' by Enrique Santos Discépolo, written in the early thirties, counterposed the liberal positivistic nationalism with a gloomy, destructive view of the new Argentina.
'Those that don't cry don't feed', Santos sang, 'and those that don't steal are fools'.
<fnote>Enrique Santos Discépolo, 'Cambalache', in The Argentina Reader, p. 267.
</fnote>Despite this loathing with politics, the middle class adopted the tango as an aspect of the new, dynamic and modern culture that Argentina was now adopting.
In this, the cinema played a big, yet not unambiguous role.
Argentina was steadily adopting the Northern American cinema culture.
In 1930, around a thousand film screens could be found throughout the country.
However, already by 1926 an estimated 95 percent of screen time was filled by films from the United States.
Tango reached a mass audience when sound was added to cinema films, and a number of glamorous films with appealing tunes lent this formula its great success.
Unfortunately this also caused tango to become a mass cultural phenomenon, alienated from its former basis of charismatic metropolitanism.
By the late thirties, fifty such films were produced a year, also serving as a charming and successful export product for other Latin American countries.

</fnote>While the metropolitan immigrant gained commercial ground and mass appeal, other cultural forces were working from above, posing questions at a more political and intellectual level.
X-Ray of the Pampa was published in 1933, melancholically referring back to inner country Argentina as a real source of Argentine national identity.
In the essay, Ezequiel Martínez Estrada accused the central government in the metropolitan centre of cultivating city values at the cost of the 'countryside, which is full of truth and life'.
Minority immigrant groups, faced by the dominance and lack of understanding of the overwhelmingly Catholic Hispanic cultural majority, attempted to secure themselves a place within the Argentine identity.
Jews, who were often particularly victim of racism, attempted, with relative success, to bring the issue to attention in the theatre.
A number of Jewish playwrights wrote plays on Argentine Jewish families and their cultural problems, with strategies varying from the complete abandonment of any distinctive Jewish identity', to the incorporation [...] of Argentina's many immigrant groups, their concerns and their idioms'.
The playwright César Tiempo in 1937 even won a prestigious theatre prize for one such play with a light-hearted tone, Pan criollo [Native Bread].

</fnote>The literature of Jorge Luis Borges forms a totally separate category in Argentina's intellectual life of the thirties.
Whilst his outlook towards nationalism was complicated and peculiar, both the political left and right came to agree 'that what the fictions display is mastery'.
Initially, Borges became part of the capital's avant-garde poetry circle, whose most famous representative was Oliverio Girondo, and his first published poems still breathe the excitement of metropolitan life.
By the 1930s, however, Borges came to reject Martín Fierro's nativistic idea of argentinidad as well as the avant-garde as 'infantile disorders'.
Perhaps due to some drastic changes in Borges' life over the second half of the thirties, among which the death of his father, a short period of serious illness and a mindless job as a librarian, Borges increasingly came to see all experiences as individual.
Increasingly, Borges disapproved of simplistic, mono-cultured concepts of Argentine nationalism, in which some groups were downplayed in favour of others.
Instead, he proposed that <fnote>Jean Franco, Critical Passions: Selected Essays (Durham/London, 1999), p. 328.

</fnote>This deconstructionist view of argentinidad cut short all aspirations toward an inward-looking, 'authentic' national identity, and hence, Borges later came to be regarded as an early exponent of postmodernism.
Throughout the 1930s, Borges was still very much in search of new values, comparing the Argentine with the Jew, whom, according to him both had no 'particular national tradition', while the entrenchment in a narrow set of national values was 'negative, or, at the very least, uncreative'.
Soon, he would move on to a path of displacing, often surprising literary creations, revealing elements of both ironic genius as elitism.

This samba's going to end in jail' <fnote> Patrícia Galvão, 'Where They about Rosa Luxemburg', in The Brazil Reader, p. 166.</fnote></heading>The 1930s as a definable decade for Brazil started in October 1930, when a group of young army officers overthrew the long-standing São Paulo oligarchy and brought GetúlioVargas to power - a dictatorship that was to last until 1954.
This inaugurated an era of modernisation to the country, and a new search for a national identity.
Gradually, art forms and cultural expressions of the lowest classes (in Brazil this mainly meant the former slaves) became accepted by a wider public, and eventually even representative as national symbols.
Dances like the samba and capoeira and the carnival of Rio de Janeiro - though often in commercialised and regularised forms- now became celebrated aspects of the Brazilian national identity.
The film genre of the chanchada came hereby to play an important role, as it familiarised people from the cities with the cultural life of the favelas, the neighbourhoods of the poor black people, revealing 'its misery and at the same time its tremendous beauty'.
Literature and poetry, on the contrary, became increasingly politicised throughout the thirties.
Already in 1931, many of the writers in the Modernist movement were aware of the ideological clash that the Vargas government was driving the cultural community into.
This drove a number of intellectuals to the Communists' side and often into imprisonment, as they presented a 'proletarian nation' in their work.
The most lasting national cultural legacy, nonetheless, comes from the bambas of the favelas.

</fnote>While in the early decades of the twentieth century public concerts of samba were out of question, the 1930s marked a slow shift toward toleration of the music and dance.
Whereas previously lovers of samba 'had to sing it far from the police', gradually a case was being made for acceptance of "black" art forms.
Amidst the still prevalent racism in Brazil, Gilberto Freyes presented his theory of 'racial democracy' in 1933 with the publishing of his book The Masters and the Slaves.
In it, Freyes argued that the contribution of Afro Brazilians added to the rich cultural mix in which Brazilian tradition was embedded.
It has been argued, in fact, that consumption of Afro Brazilian food and music were already prevalent among all classes in a discrete sense since the nineteenth century.
However, now supported by the state, who saw in the lower classes an important element for the maintenance of the status quo, the samba culture increasingly gained space in the public sphere.
The gatherings and parties held in the house of Tia Ciata have been said to serve as a microcosmic example of Brazilian society.
Each room in her house had different musical genre performances, with in the front rooms -near to the street- respectable dances such as the polka, and toward the back samba and percussive, "ethnic" rhythms.
Over time, as the samba gained momentum and respectability, it started to refine and develop in a multitude of exponents.
Fusing African rhythms and European tonal scales into a more accessible style, the samba now became acceptable for the wealthier white classes.

</fnote>Central to the samba scene in the favelas were the batuqueiros, or bambas.
These dancers performed the capoeira, a self-defence technique disguised as a dance, which had been developed by runaway slaves.
In street carnivals, where performers paraded through the streets, the bambas were singled out for their particular talent for improvised dancing.
As the carnival was becoming bigger, it became also more organised.
So-called Escolas de Samba (samba schools) started to predominate the street carnival, now participating in officially organised competitions for monetary prizes and social recognition.
Thus, gradually, the samba culture came to serve as a means for increasing respectability and social mobility, with the samba schools as benefactors of neighbourhoods, bringing education and increasing unity in Rio de Janeiro.

</fnote>Whether empowering the black lower classes, or simply reducing their contribution to 'the picturesque and the folkloric', sure is that samba contributed to Brazilian nation-building as it transcended the regional differences and immensely varying dialects.
Over time, the samba thus became a national symbol.
The production of Brazilian films brought a major contribution in the transformation of samba into a mass culture, and thus to some extent in the emancipation of black Brazilians.
With the coming of sound in films, the most popular film genre became, as had been the case in Argentina, a light story incorporating popular songs.
The Brazilian version of such films was the chanchada, which, although never entirely unambiguous, has been described in its widest sense as 'the generic name given to all the comedies and musical comedies, with popular pretensions'.
As could be expected, Rio de Janeiro emerged as the centre of Brazilian cinema in the 1930s, closely linked to the samba schools and the carnivals, in the sense that chanchada films embraced similar values and were often released around the time of carnival.
In films such as Alô Alô Brasil (1935), featuring Brazilian film star Carmen Miranda, and Alô Alô Carnaval (1936), featuring her sister Aurora, blacks played minor roles as musicians in the songs.
The presence of blacks in chanchadas, however marginal, were rather significant as they meant the open incorporation of "black culture" in Brazilian national culture.

</fnote>The extent to which the Vargas government influenced the incorporation of samba culture is blurred.
Although Vargas showed some minor active support for the movement by founding the National Institute of Educational Film (INCE) in 1937, which was to serve national integration, this institute was actually short-lived, while the number of long feature films decreased toward the end of the decade.
Moreover, the culture of the favelas brought with it the 'dialectic of malandragem', which was a concept of using the established order for illegal interests and to avoid 'the punishment of work'.
Malandragem attempted to function alongside the order of society, thus obscuring the brisk line between order and disorder.
It is therefore likely that these cultural shifts were rather a wave that accompanied the emancipation of the former slave classes than a conscious attempt at nation-building for the Estado Novo.

</fnote><fnote>Rowe and Schelling, Memory and Modernity, p. 128.
</fnote><picture/>Traditional high culture in Brazil's thirties was preoccupied with another struggle, that against the right-wing dictatorship.
Much of the intelligentsia and artistic scene, united in the Popular Front, chose the direction of regionalism.
Upper class painter Tarsila do Amaral, after having explored aspects in Brazilian nativism in her work, now started to focus on representing traditional every-day scenes of the countryside.
According to Gilberto Freyes, the 'soul of Brazil' was to be sought in the rural north, which was struck by poverty and where many sugar plantations were situated.
The regionalist movement, however, incorporated a wide range of ideologies opposed to the Vargas regime.
Raquel de Queirós, in 1930 published Back in '15, a novel on the plight of the northern region during the famine period of 1915.
In 1937 she was imprisoned for her radical Trotskyist political outlook.
Regionalism thus often served to point class inequalities in a radical leftist outlook of Brazilian society.
A less covered ideological viewpoint is provided in Patrícia Galvão's 'proletarian novel' Industrial Park (1933), where she focuses on the injustice of the Brazilian system.
Elements of nationalism are obviously subjugated for the purpose of class struggle, as in the following passage.

</fnote>Other poetry, although not as explicitly communist as Galvão (who, for this reason, spent four years in prison as a political prisoner), focussed on the rough and oppressive facets of the regime through from a national perspective.
The liberal Mário de Andrade in his poem 'The Wagon of Misery' ridicules the regime with deliberate spelling mistakes.

</fnote>Brazilian literature and poetry of the modernist movement revealed thus revealed a highly politicised, polemic style, much embedded in the opposition of the dictatorship and united through this opposition rather than through a shared outlook of Brazilian nationalism proper.

</fnote><heading>Mexico: 'A dark Indian, grateful to the party'</heading>In Mexico, the revolution proved to be the 'defining event', shaping the nation for the remainder of the century.
For many, the success of the 1910s revolution was the culmination of revolutionary nationalism: the yoke of a century of oppression had now been thrown off.
In an attempt to create a "new man" and "new woman", the new government turned to art, popular culture and education to create a new sense of nationhood for the Mexicans.
The new Mexican nation now came to incorporate and celebrate a new group of inhabitants that had been previously been seen as passive and inferior: the Mexican Indian.
The art of the 1920s and 1930s is thus marked by a fresh interest in Aztec art and architecture, and a celebration of the 'Indian race' can be found in nationalistic essays.

</fnote>By the thirties, a new political machine, the National Revolutionary Party, had been put in place and the work of myth-making of Mexican heroes of the revolution started.
This period has been marked the post-revolutionary period, as legitimising the state, as well as instilling a paradoxical blend of conservative revolutionary sentiments in Mexicans.
This new ideological stream, indigenismo, was reflected in the mural paintings of Mexico's most prominent modern artists, in the work of intellectuals and in the number of epic novels about the revolution that were published in the twenties and thirties.
It has, however, been held that for the government the aim was not 'to 'indigenize' Mexico, but to 'Mexicanize' the Indian'.

</fnote><fnote>Martin, Journeys through the Labyrinth, p. 45.
</fnote><fnote>Rowe and Schelling, Memory and Modernity, p. 184.
</fnote>Indiginismo involved the reinterpretation of both the Indian and the nation.
It involved, on the one hand, the creation of the myth of the radically social and progressive new Mexican nation, and on the other hand, a glorification of the Mexican Indian and their past.
By the 1930s, however, the emphasis was shifted from race to culture.
An interesting example can be found in the issue of bank notes.
The depiction of a 'native woman, wearing traditional costume, standing before the Aztec calendar stone' was never circulated, and instead the images of Zaragoza and Madero were preferred.
Now, notions of 'literacy, nationalism, notions of citizenship, sobriety, hygiene, and hard work' became part of the ideological mores; the Indians were believed to possess those qualities to an exceptional extent.
They were, in fact, 'rational political actors with modern sensibilities'.
To fit this singular representation, a new kind of Indian peasant emerged in literature: <fnote>Dawson, 'Indigenismo and the 'Revindication' of the Mexican Indian', p. 282.

</fnote>Another aspect of this indigenismo were the rural ballads, corridos.
They are transformed to be used on mass scale, into three-minute songs to be played on the radio Agustín Lara became the icon of this typically Mexican musical exponent.
Often in appraisal of revolutionary heroes, corridos with their simple rhyme were easy to remember and thus accessible to considerable percentage of illiterate Mexicans.

</fnote>Yet another way in which the revolutionaries were eternalised and epitomised as heroes of the Mexican nation was through the paintings of Diego Rivera, Jose Orozco and David Alfaro Siqueiros.
These modern artists - 'Los Tres Grandes'- had started in the twenties to experiment with mural painting, a style which they thereafter used effectively for the depiction of Mexico's indigenous history, scenes of the revolution and of the modern, industrialised, progressive state.
Supported and often commissioned by the government, these painters fulfilled 'the visual component of [the] need to create that Mexican citizen necessary for the survival of the post-Revolutionary state'.

</fnote><picture/><picture/>In terms of literature, the 1930s saw a continuation of the style employed in the twenties.
Epic works with 'the man on horseback', the archetypical revolutionary also depicted in the mural paintings of the post-revolutionaries.
Where Guzmán had in 1926 recounted his memories in the revolutionary army of Villa with The Eagle and the Serpent, Gregorio López y Fuentes in 1932 created an epic hero out of Zapata.
His novel The Land provided the sense of heroic Mexican leadership that legitimised the Mexican revolution.

</fnote>There were, of course, also many writers opposed to this mythical image.
In fact, the Mexican revolution brought no generation of poets of any significance; most of them were to be sought with the defeated reactionaries.
Gómez Marín, who lived in London at the time wrote in a letter: 'From here, Mexico is something dark and bloody'.
Moreover, the corrido, typical Mexican icon, could naturally also be used for other purposes than the glorification of the revolution.

</fnote>Arguably, illiteracy rates stood in the way of effective nation-building through literature.
Some have thus asserted that 'it [was] film, not writing, which create[d] [...] the 'imagined community' of the nation'.
Indeed, when the first film with sound was made in 1931, it was sponsored by state funds.
Such films, which like in the case of Argentina and Brazil, were capable of reaching as mass audience, dealt with popular themes such as destitute prostitutes (which, of course, fuelled the macho discourse of the frail woman in need of protection) and went accompanied by popular tunes, most notably those of Agustín Lara's soundtracks.
The state was quite involved in the ideological message such films conveyed.
Thus when the Soviet filmmaker Eisenstein, visiting Mexico, planned to make a film on the history of Mexico, the government withdrew their subsidies for fear that such a film might cause an outrage amongst the oligarchic hacienda owners.

</fnote>In the aftermath of the revolutionary decade (1910-1920) in Mexico, the new authorities then energetically set about constructing the archetype of a new "ideal Mexican".
This was based upon a renewed enthusiasm about the Indian, who was henceforth to be considered as a part of the new Mexican state.
Indigenismo and, from the late 1920s into the thirties, revolutionary myth making played a big role in such representations.
Nationalism was hence instilled through popular means: mural painting, the corrido ballad, film, and to some extent, epic literature.
By actively interfering and negotiating these art forms, the state sought to channel the multitude of opinions into a glorification of the new Mexicanidad.
<heading>Conclusion </heading>Nationhood is a fluid concept.
It can be manipulated to incorporate whatever ideological ideas, and exclude or obscure what one does not find appropriate to it.
Argentina and Brazil in the 1930s saw the beginning of a great transformation of nationhood, while Mexico had already begun that project directly after the Mexican revolution.
Although often the state attempted to control cultural representations of its nationalism, intellectuals and poorer minorities did not let this happen easily.
Borges refused to accept a simple, patriotic nationalism, thereby brilliantly revealing the paradoxes underlying such a concept; in Vargas' Brazil, the government was in a constant state of war with its poets and authors on the left, while former slaves of the favelas proved to be able to provide Brazil's most uniting and lasting national identity.
Perhaps the Mexican state can be said to have succeeded best at imposing an official picture of nationalism.
Their corridos and murals invoked a revolutionary-ideological Mexicanidad, party-style; and it would only be by the 1990s that Mexican natives started to wage war on that identity.
Nevertheless, the successes in Mexico also knew their limits.
The Catholic religion proved impossible to curb, while student protests in the 1970s already revealed the violent antagonism underlying the picture of Mexico that the government offered its people.
Representations of national identity, then, are inherently linked with political ideology and power.
Brazilian authors with tendencies toward communism provide the example; they employ a highly politicised image of the 'true Brazilian' proletariat.
In Argentina, such representations resulted in two opposing views, the gauchoesque patriot, modelled after Martin Fierro stood in contrast to the liberal modernist 'rational' Argentine inspired by Sarmiento's Facundo.
When tango, the voice of the minorities, and Borges came into the equation, a mono-cultured Argentine ideal became more complicated and troublesome.
Similar in each of the three countries discussed, however, are the influences of 'lower' cultural forms.
Tango, initially despised by all respectable layers of society, became the epitome of Argentinidad and proud export product after its success in the Parisian salons, while the samba of the Brazilian blacks became a national virtue.
In Mexico, the corrido and new popular film both served the ideal of praising the spiritual idealism that belonged inherently to the Mexican man and woman, as opposed to the violent pragmatism of Northern American men, and the dehumanised star beauty of the Hollywood actress.
Nationalism in all countries discussed, became increasingly represented in popular ways, reaching out to a mass audience.
The constructors of such nationalistic forms sought to reach out to an unprecedented number of people, instilling upon them these new forms of nationalism.
In Brazil, chanchadas united the country despite its immense differences in dialect, while in Mexico the party did their best to involve nationalism in every possible cultural and educational aspect.
In Argentina it culminated in the decade of Peron's popular dictatorship.
It can thus be said, that across these nations, the 1930s transformed nationalism into a popular and far-reaching construct.
The advent of the Solidarity strikes and protests halfway 1980 struck a serious blow at the Polish communist regime.
Whilst it provided a powerful response of workers to the repressive character and 'determination [of the Polish regime] to maintain [the political and economic] systems, whatever their human costs and lack of legitimacy', an important questions comes to mind.
Where from came this powerful articulation of demands, and of 'the most powerful, sophisticated and advanced working-class movement yet seen, certainly in the 'communist' sphere and perhaps anywhere in the world'?
To answer this question, it may be fruitful to study the emergence of new class societies in Eastern Europe, paradoxical when matched with Marxist thought.
Economic and political developments throughout the 1970s united with a blend of national-historical and wider Eastern European economic grievances to prepare the ferment for 'a new generation of protesting workers with a clearly different way of articulating their grievances [as] a strictly Polish phenomenon'.
In this essay I will have a closer look at the development of a class spirit among Polish workers, and argue that it was from their socio-economic situation that discord arose.

</fnote>The prehistory of the Solidarity movement was, most importantly, sparked by an increasing crystallisation of a "class consciousness" within the ranks of the Polish work force, many of whom were becoming convinced 'that they [could only] improve their lot collectively'.
Despite official state rhetoric, there was an increasingly realistic attitude to the existence of a new dominant class made up of 'the intelligentsia as a whole rather than just the bureaucracy narrowly defined'; a class of highly educated, better-rewarded technocrats and managers, charged with the daily affairs of increasing efficiency of production and economic policy making.
While official policy claimed to pursue a policy of egalitarianism, the reality behind these claims was only limited.
The producing classes, those of the workers and peasants, found themselves on the same position in the material hierarchy as before, while a decrease in real standards of living were initially concealed only by the relative success of social mobility.
However, the stretch of social mobility had its limits and by the 1970s a new generation of workers, unfamiliar with opportunities for social mobility, many of them younger than 25 years of age, began to form an increasingly articulate and assertive sense of collective grievances.
While according to the orthodox theory of communism the party was the vanguard of the workers, epitomising its real interest, workers on the work floor reportedly referred to 'management in the third person, reserving "we" for themselves'.
This clearly meant the beginning of an independently developing working class, at odds with the intelligentsia and a regime increasingly alienated from Poland's new social reality.

</fnote>Similar to the England of the early nineteenth century, the creation of a new Eastern European working class indeed took place within the rather short timeframe of one or two generations.
Over the decades after the Second World War, an average of nearly fifty percent of the younger peasantry came 'to form the new working class, [and] to create the social drama of a new life, a new world'.
As their direct socio-economic interests began to reveal themselves in increasing antagonism with the state-directed economic policy, Polish workers, as a class an sich and with an agenda different even from that of the oppositional intelligentsia, more and more often became involved in violent confrontations with the state.
Social discord became increasingly apparent, and ''Poles murdered by Poles, workers murdered by a 'Workers' State', became the symbol for all their accumulated grievances'.

</fnote>Timothy Garton Ash's assertion that 'December 1970 [was] the single most important date in the pre-history of Solidarity', may provide further insight into the extent that Solidarity was connected to the working class.
Its reaction to the government's implementation of food price increases revealed signs of a growing unity and singular purpose of action.
When the government resolved to give up its policy of consistent non-unemployment 'aimed at forcing greater productivity through the use of threat of unemployment as an incentive for better and more efficient work', this seemed a direct threat to workers at large.
After strikes and violent confrontations throughout January 1971, the government withdrew its economic reform plans, while Gomułka was forced to step down as a consequence of his unpopular repressive measures and number of deaths as a direct consequence thereof.
This political outcome was seen by many protesters as a direct result of their protests, which served made workers realise where there strength lay.
Throughout the 1970s, many strikes followed, and although the regime 'exacted its revenge on the workers', resulting in many workers being 'sacked, arrested, beaten, jailed', strikers usually got what they wanted.
This, and the fact that many protests 'involved a large group which was generally representative of the worker population as a whole', accounts for the growth of an awareness that the economic situation of workers was connected with, and could be influenced by, their political role as an occupational group.

</fnote>Yet, what made for the timing of this growing self-awareness?
Where from came the momentum that enabled workers to start attempting to influence their economic position through strikes?
The Polish communist party had, from the onset, based much of its legitimacy through the reasonably successful initiation of a process of social mobility upward.
Workers were recruited from among the peasant ranks, while better-educated workers were needed to support the growing bureaucratic apparatus.
These developments enabled many to enter new realities that were hitherto undreamed of, creating a sense of greater equality, if not of material wealth, then of opportunity.
It also sparked, however, another process, which would later develop into one of the primary reasons for the antagonism between the workers and the intelligentsia as a whole.
The quick development of industries created a culture of technocracy, in which economic status became more directly related to 'a hierarchy of statuses based on diplomas, irrespective of the actual amount of work done'.
This put pressures on access to higher education as a direct way of material advancement, as the intelligentsia were protective of their traditionally advantaged position.
The attitude of this "red bourgeoisie" was becoming an assertion '[t]hat they do and should live better than workers'.
This, however, created tension, as these 'unequal patterns of allocation of social rewards' were legitimised by the class that benefited from it, 'despite the traditional systemic commitment to egalitarianism'.
With the decreasing flexibility in the Polish labour market, most economists and sociologists began to note a shift from 'phases of system-building to the tasks of system-maintenance'.
The loss of revolutionary economic appeal for the masses, however, eventually began to cost the Party members as well; 'between October 1980 and March 1981 the Party lost 216,000 members, bringing total membership below three million'.

</fnote>The stagnation of social mobility can be said to have a two-sided effect.
While, one the one hand, it formed a ferment for discontent because the state failed to meet the workers' expectations of equality, Eastern European 'regimes [had to], in a sense, deal with the workers they have'.
While the legitimating narrative came out of redistribution, 'the technocrats, like the ruling elite itself, [had] an interest in keeping labor in a dispositive position', which entailed maintenance of the status quo.
A further source of frustration was found in the fact that, despite repeated pledges for reform from the party leadership, very little change was noticed, while concessions were repeatedly watered down.
This was particularly hard to swallow since continually facts were coming to light revealing the decadent and privileged world that the small number of the party and administrative élite' had created for themselves.
Contradictions were experienced very starkly when any kind of protest was followed by measures on a worker's economic privileges and 'any sign of active solidarity' was immediately called 'political conspiracy'.
Gradually, workers began to connect their economic discontent with a wider, social picture, which thoroughly undermined the legitimacy of the state.
As now the argument of economic prosperity was no longer something Gierek could count on, the social and political situation became something of a ticking bomb.

</fnote>The decade running up to the strikes of saw an increasingly untenable paradoxical situation.
According to Marxist thinking, communism provided the means to stop the alienation of the workers; yet, they were becoming increasingly alienated.
This was clearly demonstrated by the slow production process of inferior quality produce.
By the 1980s, an observer described "the Polish situation as 'the emergence of workers as a distinct, albeit unorganized, political force and the inability of institutionalized leadership groups to integrate the workers into the existing pattern of systematic operations'.
It is important to note, that the origins of this alienation were, to a great extent, class-originated, coming from the specific economic grievances of the workers.

</fnote><fnote>Weydenthal, 'Poland: Workers and Politics', p. 187.
</fnote>Economic alienation eventually meant political alienation, which then began to organise itself.
The strikers of 1980 were no longer easily reintegrated.
They were 'far more disciplined; they were not committed to socialism or the party' any longer, whereas large sections of Poland's industrial workers in 1970 were still prepared to give the regime another chance, in 1980 Lech Wałęsa bitterly reminded his co-workers of how little had been done with the workers' trust and support.
If the Party was not prepared to listen to their grievances anymore, the workers would organise themselves outside the state.
This essentially foreboded the inability to continue any profitable form of communism.

</fnote>We have observed that the regime became increasingly inapt to rally the support of the workers for the socialist cause, or to reasonably incorporate them within a plan economy.
It is, nonetheless, important to have a closer look at the reasons that caused the process to assume such a radical working class character.
Surely, there existed a strong section of "critical intelligentsia", yet their position was precarious: whereas they assumed a role as the voice of the working class, they were also 'part of the intellectual class, from which neither its structural position nor its value-system [allowed] it to secede'.
It is said, moreover, that moral decay could be observed across the intelligentsia - so much so, that one sociologist spoke of 'the 'semi-feudalisation' of Polish society'.
The success propaganda of communist society that western historians are quite familiar with, also seemed to have blinded the regime, rendering it numb to criticism or alternative ideas.
This hostile view, however, is only useful to a certain extent, and it is more likely that many members of the intelligentsia simply still '[had] a stake in the status quo and, therefore, support[ed] it'.

</fnote>There were, however, also initiatives from the intelligentsia within broad daylight of the Party's political sphere, which provided powerful criticism of the way in which the state treated dissident workers.
And while many intellectuals desiring reform continued to trap themselves in 'an iron cage' of 'the limits of possible reform', organisations such as the Committee in Defence of the Workers (KOR) set out in a number of semi-legal ways to create a bond of solidarity between workers and intellectuals, an number of them eventually becoming involved in Solidarity.
Examples of selfless and risk-taking initiatives are not hard to find; intellectuals such as Miroslaw Chojecki lost their jobs, continuously spent time in jail and got beaten up, in the meanwhile enabling the publication of 150 illegal books.
The problem of intellectualism and political involvement, however, would eventually cause problems by 1989, when, during the round table talks intellectualism gave the negotiations an air of secrecy and 'institutional horse trading'.

</fnote>By 1970, n increasing awareness of the existence of social class was observed in Polish society.
This classification was not so much based upon political affiliation as upon material wealth.
Rapid industrialisation since World War Two had brought new realities urban workers, a large number of them of young age, in a setting of narrowly confined economic possibilities.
When rapid economic and industrial development began to slow down and the initial success story of social mobility began to lose its stretch, problems became observable.
The popular official state narrative of egalitarianism became increasingly exposed, whereas the state had little means to provide alternative justifications.
In a situation that was becoming more and more complicated, the workers soon discovered the power of strike and protest, something which the regime was rather fearful of.
With no alternative means of political participation, the working class was rapidly becoming self-aware and radical, while the regime, with a large number of critical intellectuals torn between the rigor of party policy and the difficulty of reform, proved unable to control economic decline and the social outcry against party elitism and decadence.
A state that claimed to hold the interests of workers as its highest principle was rapidly losing support from just that group.
The strikers of Solidarity were no longer easily drawn back into the folds of socialist society which had, according to them, structurally failed to improve itself.
A number of critical intellectuals, however, come to the aid of the workers.
The KOR created effective means of communication between different workers' groups, and bridged the gap of solidarity between intellectuals and workers.
Nonetheless, the development of Solidarity must be viewed as a broad expression of workers' grievances with the sympathy and support of a number of critical intellectuals.
